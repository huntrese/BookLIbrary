They approached her and forcibly dragged her by the arm outside the office.</p><p>One of them, who seemed to be the leader, ruthlessly slapped her on the face. He was evidently vexed. In a threatening manner, he asked, “You’re that b*tch’s sister?!”</p><p>Yun Shishi was stunned. She cradled her stinging cheek and studied them. She then realized who the ‘b*tch’ that they were talking about was!</p><p>“Y’know how much that sister of yours owes me?” He chewed on gum, his eyes looking her up and down a few times.</p><p>Yun Shishi docilely pursed her lips and kept her silence. Very quickly, she sorted everything out and understood the entirety of the situation.</p><p>Calling Yun Na to mind, she probably incurred this huge debt while she was out having fun. Her family’s financial situation was still unstable, so she had no money to pay off her debt. When she could not pay them back, she thought of her and gave her company’s address to these people.</p><p>Yun Shishi felt a little regretful inside. Worried that her father would meet setbacks at work and would be unable to contact her, she left her company’s address to them. Never did she think that uninvited guests would show up, though.</p><p>However, she was unwilling to submit to these few hoodlums. Her reluctance did not stem from her having a backbone but, instead, from her being under financial strains as well. If she helped Yun Na pay off her debt, then she would not have enough to pay Youyou’s school fees for the next semester.</p><p>Watching her remain silent, the leader became enraged. He grabbed her by her shirt collar and tapped her face. “Are you a mute? Know how to speak? Speak up will ya?! Damn it!”</p><p>“Can’t pay up, can you?!” A few of the thugs shoved her around. Several pairs of eyes, harboring evil intentions, peeked at her chest. “It’s alright if you can’t pay up! You hafta behave and come with us! Got no money to pay? There are many other ways to do so!”</p><p>“Speaking of which, you, little girl, look pretty good. Interested in playing with us?”</p><p>The few of them smiled, their eyes containing malicious intentions.</p><p>Yun Shishi maintained a poker face. “Please speak with more respect.”</p><p>“Ho! Ha ha! This girl has got an attitude!” The man gave her a sinister smile and then proceeded to slap her again. “Why are you so damn savage with your words?! What’s the reason behind owing money and not paying it back?!”</p><p>Yun Shishi slowly turned her face back, her hand furtively feeling for her phone in her pocket. This little move, however, was noticed by the few men. The leader furiously clenched her wrist and flung her phone to the ground. The man stomped down once, and the phone was smashed into pieces.</p><p>She was shocked. In her eyes showed agitation.</p><p>“Calling the cops on us? Never thought you’d be quite smart!” the man spat. He then pushed her to the ground and sent a hard kick to her shoulder. “Call the cops now! I’ll let ya call the cops!”</p><p>“Boss, didn’t that b*tch say this woman has a kid? Come to think of it, which kindergarten is he at?” One of them gave her a meaningful glance.</p><p>Yun Shishi frantically lifted her face, instinctively spurting, “Don’t! Don’t find trouble for Youyou! I – I’ll give you the money!”</p><p>She could remain rational as long as it did not involve Youyou.</p><p>Returning to her department, she hurriedly took out her ATM card with trembling hands and reddened eyes.</p></div></div>
