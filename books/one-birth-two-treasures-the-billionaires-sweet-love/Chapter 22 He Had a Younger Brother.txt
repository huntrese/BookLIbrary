Previously, even if he was in a bad mood, he could still maintain his calm in the face of a difficult-to-handle development project. However, right now, he was unfathomably annoyed – weary even.</p><p>His phone rang.</p><p>Mu Yazhe picked up the call and Mu Yichen’s babbling voice came through. “Daddy….”</p><p>“Hm? What’s the matter?”</p><p>“Daddy, my heart is in pain again. Yesterday, I had a dream; I dreamed of mommy….”</p><p>The sports car abruptly came to a stop.</p><p>Rolling down the car window, Mu Yazhe’s gloomy face appeared. “Hm? Mommy?”</p><p><em>Mu Wanrou?</em></p><p>“Not that mommy! I dreamed of a pretty lady gently calling a name, but it’s not mine… Oh… I’m not sure! Anyway, I dreamed of her and I felt at ease. It was so warm, just like….” The youthful voice paused for a while before he continued, grumbling, “I don’t like the mommy here! She’s not gentle at all. Yichen doesn’t like her… Daddy, I don’t want the mommy here! I want that mommy in my dreams….”</p><p>The little guy was wailing and being willful on the other end of the phone.</p><p>Mu Yazhe’s face was sullen, but his voice was unexpectedly gentle. “Be good, Yichen. Be good, okay? Daddy is on his way home to be with you!”</p><p>“Okay! I will wait for you, daddy!”</p><p>The call ended. The upturned corners of his mouth slowly went down.</p><p><em>Do people… really have telepathy?</em></p><p>The doctor said that since Little Yichen was a twin, he was bound to have telepathy with his other twin. However, when the girl gave birth to two boys for him back then, one was already not breathing upon his birth….</p><p>After the delivery, he sent people to that hospital to inquire about the whereabouts of the child’s corpse from the staff in charge of the operation. He wanted to give the child a proper burial. However, everyone claimed that he was already taken care of.</p><p>He deeply lamented the loss back then. However, for as long as Little Yichen could remember, he kept mentioning dreams about his younger brother to him.</p><p>He claimed that his younger brother had clean and refined features and looked exactly like him. He said that it was as if he were looking at himself in the mirror – completely identical.</p><p>Mu Yazhe had previously thought that telepathy between twins was nonsense.</p><p>However, there was once when Little Yichen had a high fever and the family doctor had him on an IV drip. While he was confined in bed, he kept calling out unconsciously, “Mommy… mommy…”</p><p>He sounded helpless and dependent, but not detached – unlike how he was with Mu Wanrou.</p><p>Little Yichen might have called Mu Wanrou ‘mommy’ on a daily basis, but he was never close to her.</p><p>When he woke up, he cried out aloud. Mu Wanrou wanted to cuddle him, but he wailed and refused her touch.</p><p>He kept on crying, “Yichen has a little brother. My little brother is sick… Yichen is heartbroken… heartbroken….”</p><p>The child back then was not saved, so where did this younger brother come from?</p><p>No one believed his words because he was a child. Children’s words carried no harm and little weight.</p><p>Little Yichen eventually stopped mentioning about his dreams.</p><p>However, he was more distant toward Mu Wanrou thereafter.</p><p>…</p><p>The next day was a peaceful working day.</p><p>However, in the afternoon, an unexpected incident made Yun Shishi lose her job.</p><p>Yun Shishi was originally planning to pass a proposal to her department head after lunch break. Just as she stepped out, a few aimless youths, dressed like hooligans, boldly injured the security guards by the company entrance. They barged into her department, flung a row of tables, and shouted her name loudly.</p><p>Their intrusion frightened everyone in the office. A few noticed the tattoos on their bodies and cowered to a corner. Rumors had it that these youths were well-known ruffians in a certain street in the capital and had powerful backers. Had Yun Shishi provoked these people?</p></div></div>
