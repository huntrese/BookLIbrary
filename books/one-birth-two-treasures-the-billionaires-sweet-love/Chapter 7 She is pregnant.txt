Don’t even think he’ll touch you again!” she said bitterly and marched off.</p><p>Yun Shishi crumpled to the ground, her spirit leaving her body. The secretary hurriedly helped her up. “Get up! The floor is chilly! Your health is important!”</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>At the Mu family’s private hospital, the secretary got a hold of the examination report.</p><p>Seven weeks pregnant. Her condition was stable. It was a pair of identical twins.</p><p>She took out her phone and reported everything to Mu Yazhe’s assistant. Yun Shishi came out of the examination room. The examination report was of no concern to her. She was now quite like a wooden puppet under anyone’s control.</p><p>In any case, she just did what she was supposed to do and went along with everything they had prepared. She needed not to worry about anything else.</p><p>The secretary came to her. Giving her a faint smile, she consoled, “Miss Yun, your condition now is very stable. Don’t get too jittery. Ha ha. You don’t have to worry about anything else. Please stay in the villa to take care of the babies for these few months. If you have any requests, please feel free to let me know.”</p><p>Yun Shishi looked up and muttered, “I want to see my father.”</p><p>Two months ago, she simply left a note behind without saying goodbye. He must be worrying about her!</p><p>The secretary tensed up. “This… Boss has instructed that you are forbidden from going outside.”</p><p>“I just want to see my father once. I don’t have any other requests. Can’t you even do just this much?”</p><p>At Yun Shishi’s beseeching look, the secretary eventually relented. “Alright!”</p><p>This was originally something hard for her to decide. According to the contract, Yun Shishi was forbidden from going outdoors. However, looking at this poor girl, who had become a surrogate at such a young age, she thought that she must have some difficulties back at home. Thus, without the CEO’s consent, she arranged a time for her to meet her father.</p><p>They arranged to meet in a café in the city center.</p><p>As soon as Yun Shishi’s father received the message, he hastily made his way there and arrived thirty minutes earlier than the stipulated time. He sat in the private room, fidgeting on his seat. After she left without bidding goodbye, he was so concerned about her that he went through many sleepless nights, tussling and tossing around in bed. His wife even frequently mocked her of being an ungrateful and heartless b*tch in his face, as though she had run away from home with a random scumbag.</p><p>Their family was crumbling apart. While the family was in dire straits, the father did not know of her whereabouts. Although when he mysteriously gained a million dollars more in his bank account the following day, he instinctively linked it to her disappearance. He even thought that something bad might have happened to her.</p><p>As a matter of fact, Yun Shishi was not his biological daughter. She was unintentionally adopted by him from a welfare center ten years ago. He actually had a biological daughter. The Yun family was doing well at that time, and seeing that Yun Shishi was an intelligent and sensible child, he decided to adopt her. He never thought that after he had adopted her, his wife and biological daughter would strongly be against her. He had not minded it at first. Thinking of the little girl’s sensibleness, he thought that she would eventually gain her wife and daughter’s consent.</p><p>However, he had been wrong.</p><p>Usually, he was too busy to care about the little things happening at home. However, as a father, how would he not know of his wife and daughter bullying her during his absence? Yun Shishi was indeed an intelligent child. Even if she suffered from his wife and daughter’s hands, she never complained to him even once. Thus, he truly felt guilty toward her.</p><p>In fact, his family was originally well-off. He had a property on the market that generated stable profits, so they were considered to be living in wealth. However, at the start of the year, a financial storm suddenly swept across the globe, leaving his entire family in shambles.</p></div></div>
