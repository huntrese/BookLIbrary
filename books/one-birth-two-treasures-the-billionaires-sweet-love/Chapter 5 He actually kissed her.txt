No men would like to waste time on this, especially when it involved a woman they had no feelings for!</p><p>Being compassionate to her?</p><p>He was her employer. He even gave her a handsome reward. This pain was something that she ought to deal with.</p><p>That pain, along with the grievances and hardships she had to stomach, flowed out uncontrollably with her tears.</p><p>She exclaimed once from the pain, her eyes turning completely red, but she stubbornly bit on her lower lip and strove not to let her weak side show. However, she was truly unable to endure such a violent invasion. She panted heavily until she was no longer able to hold it in and broke into intermittent sobs.</p><p>“Oh… oh…” She broke down like a lost kitten in the end.</p><p>The man was like a cold-blooded emperor, robbing her of everything to the point of cruelty.</p><p>The boundless pain she felt was just like the unrelenting ocean waves; as she was drowning, she was floating and sinking continuously.</p><p>Slowly letting herself go, she gradually zoned out. She stretched out her fingers to reach for something, but there was nothing she could hold on to. Everything in front of her was black and her mind was in a state of disarray.</p><p>They fit each other perfectly.</p><p>Perspiration heated up their bodies. Mu Yazhe buried his fingers into her hair. He only felt greedy for more.</p><p>She implored him with a clouded mind.</p><p>During their excitement, he suddenly felt a puff of warm moisture on his neck. He lifted his eyes slightly, only to see her biting her lip and whimpering from the agonizing pain.</p><p>Mu Yazhe’s face stiffened. Gazing on the small face that was enduring it, he subconsciously lowered his head and smacked her lips with his. The tip of his tongue intruded her cavern and captured the little snake within. He twirled it around with his and drowned in all her sobs.</p><p>A kiss, to him, was a taboo!</p><p>Kissing meant that they were mutually in love!</p><p>He had never kissed a woman before because, in his eyes, their lips were filthy. The women lingering around him were always socialites, daughters from wealthy families, or celebrities, and he had never touched any of those butterflies. However, he did not know why, but he actually kissed this one.</p><p>To be accurate, she was his first. He had never known that the sensation of a kiss could be this delicious.</p><p>Mu Yazhe slightly squinted his eyes and pressed on to her. From within a suffocating suppression, he quenched his raging thirst with poison.</p><p>On the bed were tender and romantic sentiments.</p><p>They sank into ecstasy….</p><p>…</p><p>Within the darkness, Yun Shishi opened her eyes. The piece of red silk on her eyes was totally soaked with cold sweat.</p><p>She heard the sound of shower water running from the bathroom.</p><p>She slightly nudged her body, but a sharp pain emanated from her fingertips. It turned out to be from when they were having their intimate session; her fingers clutched on to the ends of the bed. Her nails broke from all the clutching she had been doing and they sank into the tips of her fingers.</p><p>She pretended to be calm to comfort herself. Everything was over. Everything had ended… Hopefully, just this one time was enough to get her pregnant.</p><p>She had to wait until she delivered his child. Afterward, she could get the money and leave, returning to her normal life.</p><p>It was now past midnight.</p><p>Mu Yazhe took a shower and changed into a set of clothes. His tall and broad figure stood in the room, and it was overwhelming. His eyes remained emotionless. Under the moonlight, the woman curled herself in the white sheets and continued to pant. On her smooth body were traces of his brutality.</p><p>The pool of blood on the bed spread out just like a bloody flower in bloom. A ghastly sight.</p><p>Yun Shishi lay motionless in bed, her back facing him. Her body, which was curled up, was trembling and was as stiff as a stone. He looked at her – her silky, soft hair, unkempt and completely drenched in sweat, messily draped on the edge of a pillow.</p><p>He gave her a cold glance and motionlessly stood there for a moment before turning to leave.</p></div></div>
