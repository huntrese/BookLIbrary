However, his physical constitution was just too weak, and he was always down with illness. Her poor child was also fatherless from birth. To make up for this, she doted on him with all her might. She gave him all the love she had in her. This was to make him understand that even without a father, the amount of love he received could only be greater!</p><p>Hence, she gave him the name ‘Yun Tianyou’. While she thanked the heavens for blessing her with him, she also wished that he could grow up healthy.</p><p>As for Mu Yazhe, her father helped her conceal the truth from him. Her father had a pretty good relationship with the director of that hospital, and the man went against his professional ethics; helping them falsify the hospital records. Thus, Mu Yazhe remained unaware that the second baby had survived, and Youyou was able to stay with her instead of being taken away from her as well. If the man were to know of Youyou’s existence, he would definitely take him away from her; she could not imagine how desperate she would be at that!</p><p>After giving birth, she returned to the university to continue her studies. Eventually, her father’s company still went under, and later, he filed for bankruptcy to the court. That man did fulfill his promise; after she gave birth to a son for him, he paid her a sum higher than the agreed-on remuneration. He was truly generous.</p><p>This also relieved much of her burdens, and the substantial amount of money more or less helped pay off her father’s debts.</p><p>After the company closed down, Yun Yecheng worked from scratch. Nonetheless, he was already getting on in age, and having gone through the lowest point of his life, he was tied to too many things around him. He had long lost the fight in him. He was unwilling to work too hard again and be ridden with hardship.</p><p>Her adoptive mother, Li Qin, stripped off the splendor, regretted marrying the useless old prick, Yun Yecheng. She was originally a housewife, but due to life’s constraints, she had to go out and do odd jobs. However, due to her previous life of comfort, she developed a habit of nit-picking and was thus often fired from her jobs. Reprimanded by others at work, Li Qin vented her anger at Yun Shishi and her son.</p><p>Yun Na, her adoptive younger sister, had a less-than-stellar academic achievement. Her high school results did not qualify her for university, so she had to settle on enrolling in a vocational school. However, her bossy attitude often led her to some troubles; almost on a regular basis, a handful of shady thugs would come knocking at their door.</p><p>After her graduation, she loafed around even more. She had great ambition but no real ability to back it up. Unable to secure any jobs, she idled at home and hung out with those worthless thugs from day to day. At present, the entire household was dependent on her father’s measly income, yet Yun Na often misbehaved, frequenting nightclubs, and ended up in lots of trouble.</p><p>When Youyou was born, she had to breastfeed him, and this coincided with her studies. It was the toughest period of her life. She could not even sit through confinement properly. As she was accepted into a prestigious university, her workload was heavy. Whenever she was free, she had to catch up with overdue work. On a normal day, she had her part-time job while she took care of Youyou. Her body was on the verge of collapsing.</p><p>After graduating from university, she managed to land herself a high-paying job, hence the family’s financial situation improved. With her adoptive mother and sister staying at home while she was out working, she was afraid of Youyou being treated in the same way as her by them.</p><p>Back then, when she first brought Youyou home, Yun Na apathetically sneered at her. She was unable to forget her calling Youyou a ‘little b*stard’ even till now. Therefore, as soon as she got herself a job, she left the house with Youyou and rented an apartment for the both of them.</p><p>When she had to work, Youyou would be sent to a kindergarten, and he would wait for her at the entrance once he was dismissed.</p><p>She was glad that Youyou was a sensible child. Despite his tender age, he was very thoughtful and was rarely willful. He was now even able to return home without her coming to fetch him.</p></div></div>
