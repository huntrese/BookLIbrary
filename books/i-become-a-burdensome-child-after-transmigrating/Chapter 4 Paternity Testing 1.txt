Are you blind?” He said in an angry tone, “Police officer, to be honest, I’ve never had a girlfriend for years. How can I have a daughter this old? Isn’t it obvious that this is a trap?”</p><p>The police officer glanced at him. “Hah! She might be from one of the many affairs you had. Perhaps you just can’t remember?”</p><p></p><p></p><p>“Impossible. I’m definitely not her father!” Su Shengjing felt that he had been wronged.</p><p>Su Jiu immediately replied, “You’re my Daddy!”</p><p>“I’m not!”</p><p>“You are!”</p><p></p><p></p><p>“I’m not!”</p><p>“You are—”</p><p>“Stop!” The police officer finally could not stand it anymore. He told Su Shengjing, “Stop quarreling and go do a paternity test. Won’t you know whether she’s your daughter or not by then?”</p><p>“Okay! If the results show that I’m not related to her, send her away. Don’t let her cling onto me!” After speaking, Su Shengjing eagerly brought Su Jiu to the paternity testing center.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The results of the test would only come three hours later. Hence, Su Shengjing had to sit on the bench in the corridor and wait. Su Jiu wanted to sit next to him, but she was not tall enough. After struggling to climb up the bench, she sat beside him.</p><p>As if he were facing a powerful enemy, Su Shengjing moved away to the side. He did not want anything to do with this dubious child.</p><p>Su Jiu made a face as if she had been terribly wronged. “Daddy—”</p><p>“Shut up! If you call me that again, I’ll beat you up,” Su Shengjing fiercely threatened.</p><p>Su Jiu pouted, stopped speaking, and pitifully stared at him.</p><p>Unable to stand her gaze, Su Shengjing sat down on another bench to distance himself away from her.</p><p></p><p></p><p>However, Su Jiu jumped down from the bench she was sitting on and ran over to the new bench. After much difficulty, she managed to climb onto the bench and sit beside Su Shengjing as if it were a given that a father should sit beside his daughter.</p><p>Her actions left Su Shengjing speechless.</p><p>He was having a huge headache.</p><p><em>Forget it! If she insists on sitting with me, I should let her be and just ignore her. </em></p><p>The three-hour waiting time felt very long, and on top of that, it was late at night. Su Jiu was starting to feel sleepy, and she yawned again and again. However, she rubbed her eyes with her tiny hands and tried her best to energize herself.</p><p>Su Shengjing glanced at her from the corners of his eyes. Her head gradually drooped, but when she was about to fall asleep, she would sit up straight to wake up. Su Shengjing had to admit that she looked so adorable that one would want to poke her chubby cheeks.</p><p>Realizing that he was overthinking, Su Shengjing quickly averted his gaze away from her.</p><p>Suddenly, a tiny pair of hands hugged his arm. When he lowered his hands and looked down, he saw Su Jiu sleeping while leaning against his arm.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Su Shengjing became stupefied.</p><p><em>Doesn’t this girl know how to be wary of her surroundings? How can she fall asleep beside anyone? </em></p><p>He wanted to push her away, but she clung to his arms. Su Shengjing gritted his teeth. Since he couldn’t be violent toward a child, he had no choice but to endure it and act as her human-sized pillow.</p><p>***</p><p>After three hours, a large yell woke up Su Jiu. “What? Are you kidding me?”</p><p>Opening her sleepy eyes, she realized that she was lying on the bench. Su Shengjing’s back was facing her, while a medical officer wearing a white coat stood in front of him.</p><p>In Su Shengjing’s hands was a report. Since he was too shocked, even his hands trembled. “She’s really my daughter?”</p><p>“We are a professional organization. It’s impossible that we made a mistake. The test showed that the probability of this girl being your daughter is 99.9999%. In other words, she’s really your daughter.” The medical officer looked at him with an expression that said ‘Are you shocked?’.</p><p>Su Shengjing yelled, “What the heck?!!!!”</p>
