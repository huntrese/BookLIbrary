Hence, he patted her back and said, “Don’t be scared. Everything’s fine.”</p><p>In his embrace, Su Jiu suddenly felt a warmth that she had never felt before.</p><p></p><p></p><p><em>Is this the natural bond between two people related by blood? </em></p><p>In her previous life, she had also grown up in an orphanage. So, she had been unaware of who her parents were. Now that she had a father, it was time for her to make up for all that lost affection.</p><p>If this father were nice to her, she would treat him like her real father and spend the rest of her life with him.</p><p>Su Jiu softly said, “With you here, I’m not scared.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>When Su Shengjing heard this, a strange feeling rose in his heart. However, he could not tell what it was and where it came from.</p><p>Carrying Su Jiu, he climbed up the dim stairway. When he reached the sixth floor, he took out a key from his pocket and opened the rusty iron door.</p><p><em>Creak! </em></p><p>When they entered the door, Su Jiu felt a cloud of dust attack her face. She could not help but sneeze.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When she raised her head and looked at the house, her lips twitched.</p><p><em>What the heck? Is this a place for humans to live in? Even dogs will look down on such a place! </em></p><p>The house looked like it had not been cleaned for eight hundred years. A thick layer of dust covered the furniture, and the walls and ceiling had turned moldy. They gave off a musty stench.</p><p>Su Shengjing’s possessions were strewn all over the living room. Unwashed plates, take-away boxes, snack packages, beer cans, and leftover food messily lay on the dining table. His clothes also lay on the sofa in a pile, and his smelly socks were thrown everywhere. The floor was filled with trash everywhere.</p><p>Su Jiu pinched her nose and exclaimed, “Daddy, it’s so dirty!”</p><p>Her words struck Su Shengjing speechless.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Her complaint was fatal. He had actually been looked down upon by a little girl.</p><p>When Su Shengjing saw a few of his underwear lying on the sofa, he immediately placed Su Jiu down, dashed forward, and hid them under the sofa. Then, he turned around and awkwardly laughed. “Wait here for me. I’ll clean up the house.”</p><p>However, as his house was too messy, Su Shengjing did not know where to start cleaning.</p><p>He could only give up and say with an embarrassed expression, “Well… why don’t you just compromise and stay here?”</p><p>Su Jiu forcefully shook her head. “No. It’s dirty.”</p><p><em>Who knows how much bacteria is breeding in such an environment? Can anyone even stay in such a place? </em></p><p>Su Shengjing didn’t know what to say.</p><p>But when he thought about it, he realized that she was right. Children had a weaker immune system, and they easily got sick. Plus, it was true that he had not cleaned up the house for a few months, and he always forgot to throw the trash away. That was why he finally decided to clean the house.</p><p></p><p></p><p>“Daddy, I’ll help you clean up.” Su Jiu ran in and placed her tiny bag on the sofa. Then, she folded her sleeves up and started to diligently clean the trash on the dining table.</p><p>After tidying the dining table, she even took a cloth and wiped it. Seeing her, Su Shengjing felt deeply ashamed.</p><p>He was usually too lazy to clean up after himself, but now, he had a child with him. Moreover, that child was a little girl. No matter what, he could not be as lazy as before.</p><p>Furthermore, he was an adult. If he could not even match a child’s efforts, it would be too embarrassing. Even he looked down on himself.</p><p>Su Shengjing placed a chair at the entrance. After helping Su Jiu wash her hands, he carried her and placed her onto the chair. Then, he passed a packet of potato chips to her and said, “Sit here. Let me clean up the house.”</p>
