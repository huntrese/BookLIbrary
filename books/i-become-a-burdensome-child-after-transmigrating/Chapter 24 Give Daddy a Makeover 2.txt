She’s making me so angry!</em></p><p></p><p></p><p>He glared at the little girl in his arms and unhappily said, “Alright, I’ll give you to him so that you can be his daughter. Just call him your father from now on and live with him!”</p><p>After speaking, he placed Su Jiu back on the bed. He was about to leave when Su Jiu hurriedly pulled his arm and laughed. “Daddy, I’m lying to you! I like you the most. I don’t want anyone else to be my father.”</p><p>Su Shengjing stopped in his tracks. His fury immediately disappeared when he listened to her cute voice.</p><p>Turning around, he saw her cunningly smile as if her prank had succeeded. He now knew for sure that she was lying to him.</p><p></p><p></p><p>“You brat! You know how to lie, huh?” Although Su Shengjing was gritting his teeth, he could not bear to act fierce toward or hit Su Jiu. Hence, he just reached his hands out and tickled her.</p><p>Su Jiu rolled around on the bed and laughed. “Daddy, Daddy!”</p><p>Her cute laughter softened Su Shengjing’s heart, and he stopped.</p><p>After catching her breath, Su Jiu pouted and looked at him. She seriously said, “Daddy, if you don’t have all this fat, you’ll be more handsome than that uncle!”</p><p></p><p></p><p>“Really?” Su Shengjing suddenly fell into deep thought.</p><p><em>Is it time for me to go to the gym and get back those chest muscles, abdominal muscles, and biceps from the past? Then, this little girl would definitely adore me.</em></p><p>Su Jiu kept nodding. “It’s true! I don’t want you to be fatty.”</p><p>As he looked at the anticipation in her eyes, Su Shengjing had no choice but to say, “Alright. I’ll destroy all the fat on my body.”</p><p>Su Jiu secretly chuckled. The first step in giving her father a makeover had started! She was looking forward to the result.</p><p>***</p><p></p><p></p><p>After a simple breakfast, Su Shengjing walked out of the house with Su Jiu. There was a barber shop near the block. When they reached the shop, Su Jiu unexpectedly saw the future villain.</p><p>The skinny boy was standing in front of the bun shop. As he looked at the steaming buns, he swallowed his saliva and touched his empty pocket. He just stood there without taking a step forward.</p><p>Suddenly, a middle-aged woman walked past him and roughly pushed him to the side. He quickly regained his balance and did not fall. However, he merely glanced at her and left without saying anything.</p><p>Before he left, he shot a longing look at those buns.</p><p>Su Shengjing observed everything. When she thought about his miserable fate in the future, she felt a sense of pity. Tugging Su Shengjing’s sleeve, she raised her head and said, “Daddy, that’s the boy collecting trash the other day. He must have not eaten anything. Should we buy some buns for him?”</p><p>Su Shengjing was speechless.</p><p>Although he was poor and in no position to help others, he could not dismiss his daughter’s kind intentions. A few buns weren’t that expensive either. Hence, he nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll buy them now.”</p><p>Rong Si had not eaten from the previous day’s noon till this morning. He was starving, but his mother’s illness had relapsed and she could not work; they did not even have money to buy rice. Hence, he had no choice but to collect trash. This was the only way he could earn money at his age.</p><p></p><p></p><p>He had walked for a distance when a child-like voice rang behind him. “Wait up!”</p><p>The voice sounded familiar. Rong Si subconsciously turned around and saw Su Shengjing walking over while carrying Su Jiu.</p><p>Su Jiu was holding a bag of steaming meat buns. She passed it to him and said, “This is for you!”</p><p>Rong Si pursed his lips. He hesitated, and instead of taking the buns, he looked at her.</p><p>Su Jiu shot him a smile that was as sweet as the strawberry-flavored candy he had eaten.</p>
