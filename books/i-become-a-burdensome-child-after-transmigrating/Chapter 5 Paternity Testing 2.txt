This is absolutely impossible!” Su Shengjing became agitated.</p><p></p><p></p><p>He did not remember sleeping with any woman. How could he have a daughter? This was outrageous!</p><p>The medical officer seriously said, “Sir, let me repeat myself. We are a professional organization. If you don’t trust us, you can take a test at another organization.”</p><p>Su Shengjing decided to take the test again. He refused to believe this ridiculous coincidence!</p><p>However, even after going to two other organizations, he got the same results: he was Su Jiu’s father.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Su Shengjing felt like this was a supernatural occurrence. He unexpectedly had a daughter for no reason at all!</p><p>This was unacceptable. Thinking of something, he hurriedly asked Su Jiu, “Who’s your mother?”</p><p>Su Jiu shook her head. “I don’t know.”</p><p>She really did not know. The novel did not specify it either. It only mentioned that Su Jiu was born because of a fleeting relationship between Su Shengjing and a woman. Moreover, after growing up, the second female lead did not look for her biological mother either.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Su Shengjing was speechless.</p><p><em>Her mother is seriously too irresponsible. How could she abandon her daughter at the orphanage after giving birth to her? </em></p><p>He asked again, “Who told you that I’m your father?”</p><p>Su Jiu thought about it and came up with a reason. “The director at the orphanage told me. Before my mother left, she said that you’re my father. So I came to look for you.”</p><p><em>She came looking for me just like that? </em></p><p>For such a young kid to slip out of the orphanage and roam the streets without facing any bad people or danger, Su Shengjing could hardly imagine how lucky she had been.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Tears quickly brimmed in Su Jiu’s eyes. She hugged Su Shengjing’s legs and sobbed. “Daddy, don’t abandon me. I don’t want to go back to the orphanage. I don’t want to be an unwanted stray kid anymore.”</p><p>Su Shengjing gritted his teeth. “So you’re planning to cling onto me? I’ll tell you that I’m not a good man. I don’t have the money to raise you either.”</p><p>“Daddy, I don’t eat a lot. It’s really easy to raise me! Plus, if you don’t have money to raise me, I’ll earn money to support you!” Su Jiu said with an earnest expression.</p><p>“Pfft!” Su Shengjing burst out laughing.</p><p><em>No way I’ll believe you. Everyone knows that raising a kid is very expensive and tiring! </em></p><p><em>This little girl even says that she wants to support me. How can she even do that? </em></p><p><em>What a joke! </em></p><p>Su Shengjing put on a straight face. “Which orphanage did you escape from? I’ll send you back.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>This question put Su Jiu at a loss for words.</p><p><em>This bastard doesn’t even want his own daughter? </em></p><p><em>He deserves to lose his popularity! </em></p><p>Despite her thoughts, Su Jiu could understand his feelings. Anyone would be scared if a daughter suddenly appeared; they would not be able to accept that fact in a short time. However, it did not matter. She would think of a way to make Su Shengjing accept her.</p><p>Su Jiu decided to retreat a step. With reddened eyes, she sobbed and asked, “Daddy, do you really want to abandon me? I’ll be very obedient. Don’t send me back, okay? Daddy…”</p><p>She kept calling him Daddy. Anyone who heard her would tear up.</p><p>Although Su Shengjing’s heart softened, he could not support her. On top of that, he did not know how to raise a child. It would be better to send her back.</p><p>The most he could do was occasionally visit her. If he had money, he would send some to the orphanage and tell its director to take care of her.</p><p>That was his plan.</p><p>After all, he really had been unaware of this child. It was ridiculous that he had suddenly become a father and had to take responsibility for her!</p><p>As he thought about it, Su Shengjing toughened up, raised his voice, and asked, “Where did you escape from? Tell me, or I’ll ignore you and leave.”</p><p></p><p></p>
