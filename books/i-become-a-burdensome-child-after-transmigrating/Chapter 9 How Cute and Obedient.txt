When he was done, he felt like his entire body was sore.</p><p><em>This family really can’t do without a wife. </em></p><p></p><p></p><p><em>However, who would be willing to marry a useless trash like me? </em></p><p>Moreover, his precious daughter had not come here to clean his house for him. Hence, he had no choice but to suffer for all his past laziness.</p><p>Su Shengjing threw all the trash in the dustbin at the stairway. When he returned, he saw that the little girl had already fallen asleep on a chair arm, while one of her hands hugged the half-eaten pack of potato chips. As she had not rested well last night, it was natural that she would be tired.</p><p>The more Su Shengjing observed her little face, the more he felt that she looked quite similar to him when he was young.</p><p></p><p></p><p><em>It seems like she’s definitely my daughter. </em></p><p>The wind at the room’s entrance was strong, so Su Shengjing carried Su Jiu and walked to the master bedroom. He placed her onto his bed and clumsily tucked her into the blanket.</p><p>***</p><p>Su Shengjing lay on the sofa and slept for a long time. He only woke up because his stomach growled in hunger.</p><p></p><p></p><p>He sleepily sat up and ruffled his messy hair. When he regained his senses, he suddenly saw a tiny girl crouching at a corner of the sofa, staring at him with her wide, clear eyes.</p><p>As if she were afraid of waking him up, she acted extremely obedient and did not make a single sound.</p><p>When she saw that he had woken up, she smiled brightly. “Daddy, you’re awake!”</p><p>“Um… Yeah.” Su Shengjing was not used to this new form of address, and he became embarrassed. “You’re up too. Are you hungry?”</p><p>Su Jiu touched her flat stomach and said, “I’m super hungry.”</p><p>Su Shengjing once again felt that he was not doing a good job. Back at the orphanage, he had said to Su Jiu that he would bring her home and take care of her. Yet, he had woken up later than her and made her starve.</p><p></p><p></p><p><em>She has not eaten anything since last night. She must be starving to death. </em></p><p>Su Shengjing felt guilty. “Play on your own while I cook something for you.”</p><p>Su Jiu obediently nodded. “Okay. Thank you, Daddy!”</p><p><em>Wow… How cute and adorable! </em></p><p>After being attacked by her cuteness, Su Shengjing felt like he was almost going to have a nosebleed.</p><p>He stared at her as he wondered who her mother was. <em>She must be very pretty; otherwise, how could she give birth to such an adorable daughter?</em></p><p><em>Ahem, this is not the time to think about this. </em>His child was still hungry, so Su Shengjing briskly walked to the kitchen and opened the fridge.</p><p>There were quite a lot of food items inside. However, when he took them out, he realized that they had all expired.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Su Shengjing was speechless.</p><p>He always roamed outside and rarely cooked. When he was hungry, he would order food. A long while had passed since he had last opened his fridge. That was why he was unaware of what had happened to the items inside.</p><p>Enduring the pain of throwing the expired food into the dustbin, Su Shengjing walked out of the kitchen. He then told the little girl, who was obediently waiting for him on the sofa, “I’m going to buy something. Can you stay at home alone?”</p><p>Su Jiu immediately jumped down from the sofa. “I want to go with you, Daddy.”</p><p>Su Shengjing felt helpless. “Let’s go, then.”</p><p>Actually, he would feel worried about leaving such a small child at home alone. It was better if they went together.</p><p>Su Jiu ran over happily and tugged his hand.</p><p>Su Shengjing realized that her hand was soft and chubby. It was also tiny—barely half the size of his palm. Moreover, she could only grab his finger.</p><p>A wondrous feeling attacked his heart again.</p><p>As the two of them left the house and walked downstairs, Su Jiu suddenly saw a little boy.</p>
