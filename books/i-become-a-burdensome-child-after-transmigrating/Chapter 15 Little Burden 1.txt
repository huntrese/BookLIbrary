She then raised her head and looked at him. “Uncle, who are you? You’re so handsome!”</p><p>“…!” When Sheng Tianci saw a little girl suddenly appear in front of him, he was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p></p><p>He glared at Su Shengjing and said, “What the heck? Third brother, who’s this child? Don’t tell me that she’s your long-lost daughter!”</p><p>As Su Shengjing was the third eldest child in the Su Family, Sheng Tianci was used to calling him Third brother.</p><p>When Su Shengjing heard his daughter praise Sheng Tianci for being handsome, he felt a bit jealous. Hence, he pulled Su Jiu to his side and indifferently said, “You’re right. She’s my daughter.”</p><p>Sheng Tianci was so shocked that his jaw dropped. “No way! Third brother, how did you have a daughter? Did… did you do something shameless? Who’s the mother?”</p><p></p><p></p><p>“I don’t know. This girl looked for me herself.” As Su Shengjing spoke, he carried Su Jiu back to the dining table and refilled a bowl of soup for her. When he saw that her expression was normal and she was not frightened by the earlier events, he felt relieved.</p><p>Su Jiu looked at the shocked Sheng Tianci and flashed an adorable smile at him. She cutely said, “Nice to meet you, Uncle. I’m Su Jiu, and I’m almost four years old. I’m happy to meet you! Please take care of me in the future!”</p><p>No one could be immune to her cute voice. Sheng Tianci was also enchanted by her cuteness, and he even felt envious of Su Shengjing. “Third brother, how amazing! Although you’re useless at everything, your daughter is so adorable!”</p><p>Su Jiu blinked with her large eyes and continued acting cute. She sweetly said, “Uncle, you’re so handsome. You’re the most handsome uncle I’ve ever met.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>When Sheng Tianci heard her, he was elated. He subconsciously smoothed his hair.</p><p><em>Since everyone says that children never lie, it must be true that I’m very handsome. </em></p><p>Su Shengjing was a bit upset that his daughter was praising another man. Thus, he scoffed. “He’s considered handsome? You indeed have not seen much of the world, child.”</p><p>“No matter what, I’m more handsome than you now, right?” Sheng Tianci felt very proud of himself. “Find yourself a mirror and look at your reflection. You’ll realize that your daughter has better taste than you.”</p><p>Su Jiu jumped down the chair, took a bowl and a pair of chopsticks, and placed them on the dining table. Then, she obediently said to Sheng Tianci, “Uncle, eat!”</p><p>Sheng Tianci’s fatherly instincts exploded. The only thing he could think of right now was how cute the little girl was. When she looked at him, his heart almost melted due to her cuteness.</p><p></p><p></p><p>“Okay!” He agreed and sat down. Then, he teased Su Jiu on purpose, “Your name is Su Jiu, right? I’m very rich, and I really like adorable little girls like you. Do you want to go home with me? I’ll raise you well and make sure that you can eat whatever you want. You don’t need to suffer with this useless father.”</p><p>“Get lost!” Su Shengjing harshly kicked him, then looked at Su Jiu. He wanted to know how she would respond.</p><p>Su Jiu did not disappoint him. She shook her head and firmly rejected Sheng Tianci’s offer. “No. No matter how poor my Daddy is, he’s still my Daddy. I want to be together with him.”</p><p>Su Shengjing felt very touched. Luckily, his daughter had not been tempted by the offer!</p><p>Sheng Tianci immediately felt a wave of jealousy surge in his heart. Although Su Shengjing was broke and useless, he had such an obedient daughter. It could also be considered a success.</p>
