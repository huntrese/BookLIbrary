Aren’t you in your third year of high school? Have you thought of which high school to attend? Do you have any particular school in mind?”</p><p>High school.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Nian was originally focused on drinking her soup. After hearing him, she immediately looked down.</p><p>If Old Master didn’t mention it, she wouldn’t even have thought of it.</p><p>To her, high school and university were merely just words on a piece of paper. She never needed such things.</p><p>Qiao Nian pondered for a moment and shook her head. “I haven’t thought about it yet.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Jiang Xianrou thought that she avoided the question because her results were poor and could not get into a high school so she sneered in her heart. Grandpa was so ridiculous for asking which school she’s looking at.</p><p><em>Do you think you can get into any school you want?</em></p><p>Ye Wangchuan looked at Qiao Nian who was eating quietly. He leaned against the back of his chair and said casually. “Rao City High School is not bad.”</p><p>“Rao City High School?” Old Master Jiang was stunned as his original intention was to bring Qiao Nian back to Beijing to study. He then realized that Qiao Nian was also Ye Wangchuan’s fiancé. If Qiao Nian were to go back to Beijing, he may not be able to protect her as the people in Beijing were more complicated. After thinking about it, Old Master Jiang agreed. “Rao City High School isn’t bad, the teaching standard is fine. Nian Nian, what do you think?”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Rao City High School?</p><p>Qiao Nian pursed her lips, as she didn’t want to stay in Rao City.</p><p>However, once she met Old Master’s eager eyes, she nodded uncontrollably. “I’m fine with anything.</p><p>“Alright. Rao City High School, then.”</p><p>He was recuperating in Beijing, and Zongjin was working in Beijing as well. If Qiao Nian were to stay in Rao City, the second family would have to help to take care of her.</p><p>He turned to Jiang Xianrou and them, frowned, and said, “Your second brother has a house in Rao City. For your last year of high school, you can stay there temporarily.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Other than Jiang Li, the rest of them didn’t look happy when they heard that.</p><p>Although Jiang Li had a house of his own, Old Master’s arrangement seemed to be openly guarding against them.</p><p>As Jiang Xianrou was still young, she couldn’t hide her emotions and curled her lips to express her dissatisfaction.</p><p>Jiang Zongnan looked a little awkward, while Tang Wanru sat gracefully at the side, but her expression was disdainful after being involved in such a matter.</p><p>Ye Wangchuan said indifferently, “I’ll be staying in Rao City for a while, so I can take care of her.”</p><p>Qiao Nian quickly raised her head to look at him, coincidentally making eye contact with a certain person.</p><p>This gaze…</p><p>She quickly looked away, almost choking on her soup.</p><p></p><p></p><p>…</p><p>In another room.</p><p>Qiao Chen, Qiao Weimin and the family were distracted during their meal, as they kept thinking about what happened with Qiao Nian. After talking about it a few times, they started to digress.</p><p>Fortunately, He Yujuan and Tang Wei’s ties were strong. It was confirmed that Qiao Chen could enter the Humanities school after the College Entrance Examination.</p><p>Therefore, Qiao Chen’s unsettled heart finally felt better.</p><p>All the guests were happy after the meal.</p><p>He Yujuan, Qiao Weimin, and Madam Fu sent Tang Wei and her daughter off while Qiao Chen followed behind.</p><p>After leaving Waterside Loft, Fu Ge walked beside Qiao Chen. He noticed that she looked pale and distracted and asked, “What’s wrong?”</p><p>Looking at his resolute eyebrows, Qiao Chen bit her lip and shook her head. “Nothing, I just have a slight headache.”</p>
