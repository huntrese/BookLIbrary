The black Bentley slowly came to a halt.</p><p>Qiao Nian undid her seatbelt and got her bag and then thanked the man in the driver’s seat.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ye Wangchuan tipped his chin up slightly. He had one hand on the steering wheel while his other arm rested against the window. The brown beads of his bracelets stood out against his fair wrist, and they seemed to almost tame a lion. He looked out the window and saw that there was nothing special about the place. “Do you want me to walk you in?”</p><p>Qiao Nian declined his offer without thinking. “No need, I’ll go in on my own.”</p><p>Ye Wangchuan squinted slightly but didn’t say more.</p><p>Qiao Nian couldn’t wait to shake him off. She got out of the car and waved to him. “I’ll get going then, Brother Ye.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Ye Wangchuan watched as she entered the white two-story Western-style building. He then took his cell phone out.</p><p>He was a long-term resident in the capital, but he knew the land value in Rao City.</p><p>The building that Qiao Nian had just entered was in the prime district of the city’s southern region. Any unit in this area would be much pricier than a typical district, not to mention a private building.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Jiang Li had told him that Qiao Nian’s adoptive parents were rather wealthy but extremely mean to her. They didn’t even allow her to study at a better school.</p><p>How did she know of such a place? And she seemed familiar with it?</p><p>He took a photo of the white building.</p><p>It didn’t take long before a reply came in.</p><p>[I know this place! It’s a psychologist’s clinic on Jiangnan View Road. It’s extremely popular and hard to get an appointment there! The cost is steep too. Master Wang, a-are you alright? Don’t ever think it’s taboo to visit the psychologist if you need to!]</p><p>[Scram.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ye Wangchuan typed the message with one hand and sent it. He then turned to look at the entrance the girl had entered.</p><p>Psychologist’s clinic?</p><p>Steep costs?</p><p>He’d gone through information about Qiao Nian before; there was nothing special about her. But having interacted with her, he found that she was very different from what was written about her.</p><p>He was about to type another message when his cell phone lit up. A call was coming in.</p><p>Ye Wangchuan picked up his phone. His voice was a little hoarse as he asked, “What is it?”</p><p>“Master Wang, Little Young Master… Little Young Master is missing!”</p><p>His expression darkened and his muscles tensed up. He didn’t have the heart to bother about the psychologist’s clinic matter anymore. He started the car and demanded, “Where are you?”</p><p></p><p></p><p>The back Bentley pulled out of the alley at speed—</p>
