She kept a step behind him as they headed to the car and responded, “I don’t mind.”</p><p>Jiang Li looked at his empty hands and then at his young cousin. He seemed a little confused.</p><p></p><p></p><p>How had she evaded him? He hadn’t seen it clearly.</p><p>Jiang Li didn’t think too much about it and opened the door to the backseat for her.</p><p>“It’s warm outside, get in first.”</p><p>Qiao Nian had no idea what her biological parents looked like and who they were. She simply put her information up on a website for parents to look for their lost children. It didn’t take long for someone to contact her.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Weimin did the rest after she was contacted. Qiao Chen had even “accidentally” revealed to her that her parents were teachers from Luohe County.</p><p>Qiao Nian looked up at the sky and then kept her gaze.</p><p>She knew this car model. Tang Jin had told her that the car itself cost two million yuan.</p><p>This car even had a sky roof and would cost at least 3.8 million yuan.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Nian raised her brow. The car that Qiao Weimin got two years back was just five million yuan. Just who was this grandfather she had in Luohe County?</p><p>The cool air hit her the moment she entered the car, and she saw the “friend” who was joining them for a meal later.</p><p>The man seemed to be in his early 20s and appeared a little cold. There was no brand logo on his shirt, but the workmanship was fantastic; the shirt fit him perfectly. The gold buttons reflected the sunlight beautifully, and there didn’t seem to be a single wrinkle on his top. He looked like someone difficult to get along with.</p><p>But there were several beaded bracelets around his wrist, bringing about a faint scent of sandalwood in the car.</p><p>He was a strong Buddhist?</p><p>Jiang Li introduced him to her. “Nian Nian, he’s my friend Ye Wangchuan. You can call him Brother Ye.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Nian glanced at him again.</p><p>The car had huge leg room, but this man’s long legs seemed to be in an awkward position.</p><p>Qiao Nian felt his gaze on her and greeted him “Brother Ye” with her head down.</p><p>Ye Wangchuan seemed surprised to hear how meekly she greeted him.</p><p>He looked at the girl sitting by his side. Her skin was so, so fair.</p><p>When she looked up again and peered out the car window, he could see her beautiful lashes curled upwards. She was such a sweet little girl!</p><p>…</p><p>Jiang Li found a topic to engage her with every now and then, for fear that she’d feel awkward in the car.</p><p></p><p></p><p>He also tried to introduce her family background to her.</p><p>Only the man sitting right beside her kept silent the whole time.</p><p>But he was like a resting lion. Quiet as he was, his presence was impossible to ignore.</p><p>They arrived at their destination pretty soon.</p><p>Waterside Loft was situated in the city center on prime land.</p><p>It was in the busiest area possible but had a great view of the greenery as well. Waterside Loft provided some quiet in the otherwise busy environment. Hence, it was a popular choice.</p><p>“I’ll park the car.”</p><p>Jiang Li stopped the car at the entrance and said to the man behind, “Master Wang, I’ve booked the private room. You can take Nian Nian there first, I’ll go over once I’ve parked the car.”</p><p>Qiao Nian finally heard the man beside her speak. “Let’s go.”</p>
