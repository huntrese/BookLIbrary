Although the medical knowledge of popular science in the brochure was very common, the illustrations made it very interesting.</p><p>Looking up, she raised an eyebrow at the sight of Qiao Weimin approaching her aggressively. She returned the brochure in her hand, stuck her hands in her pocket, and asked indifferently, “What’s the matter?”</p><p>Qiao Weimin was triggered by her unruly attitude, and his expression changed slightly. “I have something to ask you,” he said after suppressing his anger.</p><p>Before Qiao Nian could answer, he asked as if interrogating her, “Are you staying in Rao City to study?”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes. With her thin eyelids and white skin, her pupils looked particularly dark and bright, giving a strong sense of oppression when she stared at someone.</p><p>Qiao Weimin was taken aback by her stare and explained, “Outside Waterside Loft, I heard Aunt Tang say that you’re going to Rao City’s First High School as well, so I’m here to ask you.</p><p>“Isn’t your grandpa from Luohe County? How come he agreed to let you stay here to attend school? The province has educational support programs for Luohe County every year, and the local education level there is good too. You don’t necessarily have to stay in Rao City. As long as you work hard, I believe that you can enter college no matter where you are…”</p><p>Qiao Nian sneered in her heart.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Everyone in Province C knew that the best educational resources in the province were in Rao City. Generally, Rao City’s ranking was equal to the provincial ranking, and only a few people from other urban areas placed among the top 200.</p><p>Lin City was also a second-tier city, and few students could place in the province’s top 200.</p><p>There was no place for impoverished counties like Luohe.</p><p>Qiao Weimin could really speak nonsense with his eyes open!</p><p>Right at this moment, her phone rang. She glanced at the caller ID and saw that it was Ye Wangchuan, presumably calling her to go up. She looked up to meet Qiao Weimin’s ardent gaze and said indifferently, “Just tell me what you want to say. There’s no need to beat around the bush.”</p><p>Everyone was tired of waiting for him!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Weimin stopped beating about the bush and immediately said, “Nian Nian, can you not go to First High School in Rao City?”</p><p>He really dared to say it!</p><p>Qiao Nian looked at him with cold eyes. “Why?”</p><p>Although Qiao Weimin found it too embarrassing, he still managed to say, “Your sister already received confirmation that she’ll be recommended for admission to Ren Yi after the college entrance examination. You going to Rao City First High School will only affect her badly… Her classmates have heard about our family affairs and will inevitably gossip.”</p><p>Qiao Chen was guaranteed a spot in Ren Yi?</p><p>Qiao Nian pursed her lips mockingly and wanted to laugh.</p><p>She knew Qiao Chen’s grades and knew that she usually relied on the Qiao family to spend money on private tutors. She always came to her for test questions at the end of each term and barely hung around the top 50 from the back. In addition to First High School, there were seven or eight schools in Rao City. Qiao Chen wasn’t ranked high enough. Unless she took the path of an art student, there was no way she could attend a prestigious school!</p><p>“I think Yingcai High School next door is not bad, either. If you really want to stay in Rao City, I’ll discuss it with your mom and grandma. We’ll pay for your school fees at Yingcai High School, okay?”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Weimin was afraid that she wouldn’t agree, so he added as if considering her livelihood, “Yingcai High School is similar to First High School in Rao City. Both are good schools!</p><p>“Yingcai High School is even a private high school, and the school fees are much more expensive than Rao City’s First High School. I heard that your grandpa has to return to Luohe County soon, so regardless of room and boarding, it’s impossible for you to stay in Rao City to study. Since you’ll be living on campus, it’s better to find a school with a better campus.”</p>
