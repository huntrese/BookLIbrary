They’re terrible! They used you in exchange for your sister’s life and even guilt-tripped you by claiming to be your kin… And now they’re chasing you out the moment they no longer see a use for you!</p><p>“Had you known, you shouldn’t have done so much to treat Qiao Chen’s illness. They don’t know that if it wasn’t for you, Qiao Chen wouldn’t even be able to live past 20. They think that hemophilia is a flu or something and can be treated with just a pill!”</p><p>Qiao Nian saw someone walking towards her now. She casually said on the phone, “No matter what, the Qiao family did raise me. I’ve repaid them by treating Qiao Chen. Now, we have nothing to do with each other.”</p><p>The person on the line sounded indignant. “Don’t you know how much you’ve helped the Qiao family all these years? If it wasn’t for you, Qiao Weimin would never have been able to expand his family from Rao City to the capital. He’s too dumb for that!</p><p></p><p></p><p>“And that younger sister of yours. You gave her tuition and helped her with her tunes. That family made you do everything possible!</p><p>“I used to think that they were your biological family members, but were simply biased towards your sister. Then, when I found out that they were actually not related to you, I realized how shameless they were!</p><p>“They knew full well that you weren’t related to them by blood and still took advantage of you without treating you like family.”</p><p>Qiao Nian smiled, knowing that everything the other party said was accurate.</p><p>“I know all about it!”</p><p>Qiao Nian saw that Jiang Li was approaching and lowered her volume. “I have something else to attend to, I’ll hang up first.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>“Where are you staying tonight, do you need me to fetch you from Rao City?”</p><p>“No need, my family is coming to get me.”</p><p>“You’re really going to look for your biological parents?”</p><p>Qiao Nian looked rather nonchalant as she said, “I need to know my roots at least — who I am and where I come from.”</p><p>The person on the line went quiet.</p><p>Qiao Nian didn’t want to guess what he was thinking and simply said, “Bye.”</p><p>She hung up and kept her cell phone in her pocket before Jiang Li got to her.</p><p>Everyone liked pretty people and things. Jiang Li happily took her stuff and carried them for her. “Nian Nian, am I right? I’m your cousin, Jiang Li. Just calling me Second Brother will do.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Nian looked up at him. Jiang Li was tall and rather good-looking, with a smile that made him look approachable. Some of his hair was highlighted in a bright purple, giving him a unique personality in his simple elegance.</p><p>Hm, she felt like she’d seen this face before.</p><p>Qiao Nian wasn’t one who remembered faces well. If someone wasn’t important enough to her, she’d just forget them.</p><p>“Mm. Nice to meet you, I’m Qiao Nian.” She greeted him politely. So far, she seemed rather obedient and sweet, at least to Jiang Li.</p><p>“Grandpa’s legs aren’t in a very good condition and he can’t take a plane, so he got me to pick you up. He’s taking a train and will arrive later. Your dad and my parents have reserved a place at Waterside Loft, and they should be there by now. Let’s head there.”</p><p>Jiang Li smiled as he spoke to her.</p><p>“Nian Nian, I’ve got another friend in the car. He’ll be joining us later. I hope you don’t mind?”</p>
