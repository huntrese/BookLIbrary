Instead, he warned in concern, “You shouldn’t eat too much of such medicine. Take just one tablet if you really can’t sleep at night. Otherwise, avoid taking it at all.”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>This wasn’t the first time Qiao Nian was eating such pills. She knew full well what it was about and easily agreed.</p><p>Having gotten what she wanted, she picked up her bag and was ready to leave.</p><p>Wei Lou stopped her. “Where are you heading?”</p><p>“Home,” Qiao Nian casually said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Wei Lou frowned. “Where’s your home? Didn’t the Qiao family chase you out?”</p><p>He recalled his conversation with Qiao Nian over the phone and eyed her. “You mean, you’re going to live with your biological parents?”</p><p>Qiao Nian didn’t like him coming so close and couldn’t help but take a step back. She then admitted, “Mm.”</p><p>Wei Lou saw that she’d staggered backward slightly. He felt bad about it but was helpless as well, so he simply pretended not to have noticed it. After all, out of sight, out of mind. “You hung up on me earlier because you were having a meal with your biological relatives? So, you’ve met them. What are they like?”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Nian recalled and then said, “I didn’t interact with them, so I’m not sure. I only saw my biological father. It seems like my biological mother has passed on. I’m not sure about the cause, but I’ll find out. Besides that… Grandpa is very nice to me.”</p><p>“Grandpa…” Wei Lou could tell from the way she addressed them that while she wasn’t ready to acknowledge her biological parents, she had already accepted this grandpa of hers.</p><p>Wei Lou’s heart sank as he asked very seriously, “You’re going to stay and find out about your background?”</p><p>Qiao Nian had no idea why he was always asking the same question. But she nodded patiently, anyway. “Mm. I need to know my roots at least — who I am and where I come from.”</p><p>This was a valid reason!</p><p>As much as Wei Lou wanted to take her away, he couldn’t. He knitted his brows together. “Are you intending to follow your biological father to Luohe County, then?”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Nian said, “They’re from Rao City.”</p><p>Wei Lou seemed confused. “Rao City? Didn’t you say that your biological father was from Luohe County?”</p><p>Qiao Nian couldn’t be clear, either. “I’m not too sure about the specifics. Qiao Weimin told me that they’re from Luohe County, but it seems like they actually aren’t.”</p><p>“What’s your biological father’s name?”</p><p>Qiao Nian thought about it but couldn’t recall. She didn’t quite like this sort of “interrogation”. She replied, “… His last name is Jiang.”</p><p>“Jiang?”</p><p>There was a huge Jiang household in Rao City that had come a long way. The older generations of this family were very close to the Ye family of the capital.</p><p>Wei Lou looked at Qiao Nian oddly but decided not to speculate too much.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Nian’s biological father shouldn’t have anything to do with that family.</p><p>Qiao Nian was done packing her belongings. She took a medicine jar out of her bag and tossed it to him.</p><p>Wei Lou caught it reflexively.</p><p>Qiao Nian slowly picked up her bag and said softly, “This month’s medicine.”</p><p>Three years ago, a type of medicine began circulating in the black market. The medicine was said to be as magical as the Ginseng Fruit featured in Journey to the West and could extend one’s lifespan and improve their energy level.</p><p>Everyone wanted to find out more about this medicine and the stronger powers were trying to get hold of it. There were only three of such pills on auction each month on the black market, and there was a commotion at each auction.</p><p>“Three pills again?” Wei Lou scrutinized the pills in the jar. The white pills seemed no different from candy.</p><p>But each of them was sold at an incredible price!</p>
