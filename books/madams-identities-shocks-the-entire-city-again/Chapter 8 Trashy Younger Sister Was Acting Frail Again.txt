He glanced at the adults and then asked, “Do you need to head to the hospital?”</p><p>Qiao Chen stopped him immediately as she wasn’t really feeling unwell. She then hesitantly said, “It’s alright, Brother Ge. I had this issue for quite a while already. It could have been caused by the still air indoors. I should feel better after getting some fresh air.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Fu Ge had a look of concern on his face as he tried to soothe her breathing. He gently spoke. “You should have told me if you weren’t feeling well. Aunty Tang wouldn’t mind it.”</p><p>Qiao Chen stared at his handsome face. She immediately felt that her bad mood caused by Qiao Nian disappeared. She held his hands and answered, “Alright.”</p><p>She remembered something then and asked, “I saw elder sister just now. Why was she at Waterside Loft? I recalled dad saying that her biological parents are from Luohe County. Only one train heads there every day. Could it be that she couldn’t get the tickets?”</p><p>Fu Ge frowned as he heard that. He took a look at Waterside Loft, but he didn’t put much thought into it and answered, “It could be.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Chen bit on her lip and said hesitantly, “Older sister had a fight with grandma before she left. She even rejected the money that dad wanted to give her. She must have thought that we wanted to chase her away! What about our relationship… I… Brother Ge, I shouldn’t have fought older sister for you.”</p><p>“It has nothing to do with you!” Fu Ge immediately answered as he saw that she was close to tears. “I fell in love with you first. Qiao Nian should… give us her blessings.”</p><p>Qiao Chen was frail from a young age. This was the first time that she was so determined, and it was to get together with him. He must be responsible for her.</p><p>Qiao Chen was so frail that he couldn’t bear to let anyone else take care of her. He could only feel sorry for Qiao Nian.</p><p></p><p></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>When Qiao Chen saw the cold look on Fu Ge’s face when he spoke about Qiao Nian, she felt better.</p><p>But she was still worried about the reason for Qiao Nian being at the Waterside Loft.</p><p>Hopefully, it was just a coincidence, like what Grandma said.</p><p>She calmed down and smiled. Suddenly, she saw someone.</p><p>“Qiao Nian?”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Nian was wearing the same clothes in the afternoon — a jacket over a striped top and a pair of light blue jeans shorts that showed off her long legs.</p><p>She didn’t have any make-up on, but her natural good looks attracted everyone.</p><p>Fu Ge saw Qiao Nian as well. He was so shocked that he exclaimed, “Qiao Nian?!”</p><p>Other than Qiao Nian, he also saw others.</p><p>Qiao Weimin was walking ahead of them. But when he heard what they said, he stopped in his tracks and looked at them.</p><p>Tang Wei was holding onto her daughter for support. She was initially walking in front, but she stopped talking to He Yujuan after she saw someone.</p><p>She immediately asked her daughter to bring her to Old Master Jiang. She then greeted him happily. “Old Master Jiang, why are you in Rao City?”</p><p>Old Master Jiang?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Everyone in the Qiao family was shocked.</p><p>Madam Fu remembered something as she glanced at the Jiang family.</p><p>“Jiang?”</p><p>She heard of this last name. Could it be the Jiang family that she had in mind?</p><p>Rao City’s inner circle had different levels. Even though the Qiao family was finally a part of this inner circle, they were just third-class. The Fu family was doing way better as they mixed in politics.</p>
