From the very beginning, he was full of disgust watching Qiao Nian perform first aid cardiac resuscitation.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What was she doing!</p><p>Many people heard Qiao Chen.</p><p>They suddenly pointed at Qiao Nian and discussed.</p><p>“Why is this little girl messing around?”</p><p></p><p></p><p>“You can’t mess around to save people. The ambulance is coming soon. Someone, stop her. What if she kills him…”</p><p>Many people were talking, but few were actually doing something.</p><p>Qiao Nian didn’t take the people around her seriously at all. She was frustrated and didn’t notice the chatter around her.</p><p>She accurately placed three needles at the back of the child’s neck.</p><p></p><p></p><p>After the three needles were pierced him, the child’s dirty face seemed to grow redder, and it looked like it was working.</p><p>Staring at the dying child, Qiao Chen grabbed Fu Ge’s arm in panic and fright and made a big fuss. “Sister’s crazy. That child is so young, what’s she doing!”</p><p>Zhao Jingwei also snarled. “She can’t ignore the child’s life even if she wants to play a hero. What if something happens to him?”</p><p>“… Brother Fu Ge.”</p><p>Qiao Chen was really panicking this time. If Qiao Nian had gone back to the countryside with her biological parents today, she wouldn’t care if she became a prodigy in Luohe County. But she was now still in the city. What if news of this went online, and netizens started criticizing her as well for having such a sister? Even if she wasn’t a biological sister, it would still cause trouble to her. She didn’t want to be involved!</p><p>How could Qiao Nian cause so much trouble!</p><p></p><p></p><p>The people around were influenced by her and all dissuaded and accused Qiao Nian.</p><p>Fu Ge raised his sharp eyebrows, his handsome face full of disapproval. He stepped forward, wanting to stop her.</p><p>“Qiao Nian, don’t mess around. Get away and wait for the ambulance to come first…”</p><p>Without even looking back, Qiao Nian said coldly, “Can you stop talking so much? It’s annoying!”</p><p>“…” Fu Ge’s hand froze in midair. He didn’t know whether to retract his hand or leave it there, and it was just frozen in place, indescribably awkward.</p><p>Qiao Nian had never spoken to him with this attitude before.</p><p>He couldn’t figure out what was wrong with her for a while.</p><p>Suddenly, the child lying on the ground jerked and choked. He curled up and coughed violently, vomiting all the dirty water out of his stomach…</p><p></p><p></p><p>“It worked!”</p><p>“This little girl is amazing!”</p><p>“This little girl knows medicine?”</p><p>People watching the excitement exclaimed.</p><p>Qiao Chen, Zhao Jingwei, and the others were equally stunned, especially Qiao Chen, whose eyes widened in shock. She never knew that Qiao Nian had this ability.</p><p>But the enthusiastic uncle who had been watching from beginning to end had heard Qian Chen and the others making cynical remarks just now, so he couldn’t help but say righteously, “Little girl, if you don’t want to help save the child, then forget about it. But did you still fan the flames at the side? Which school are you guys from?”</p><p>Zhao Jingwei retorted, “We don’t know how to swim!”</p><p>The old man said unhappily, “The friends around you know how to swim, but I don’t see them saving the child! You were all just standing at the side making cynical remarks! Even my parrot doesn’t talk as much as you do!”</p><p>Qiao Chen had always been spoiled since young, and because of her health, everyone always gave in to her. Usually, no one even dared to speak loudly to her for fear of scaring her. She had never heard such heavy words spoken to her before! Her complexion went pale, and she bit her lip, feeling extremely wronged.</p><p>It was a pity that the old man didn’t fall for it. He continued chiding them for a while.</p><p>In the end, he didn’t forget to say, “I don’t know which school the girl who saved the child is from, but she’s a good girl. She dared to save the child selflessly without fighting for recognition. I’ll definitely write a letter of praise to her school!”</p><p>Qiao Chen’s face was red and white. She clenched her hands into fists and was speechless for a long time.</p><p>She raised her eyes to look at Fu Ge, who was once again attracted by Qiao Nian. Pursing her lips, she covered her heart and whispered faintly, “Brother Fu Ge, my heart hurts.”</p><p></p><p></p>
