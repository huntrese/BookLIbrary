He had long legs, but she kept pace with him.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Her head was hurting a little as she grabbed her bag.</p><p>She set out to look for her biological parents just to find out who they were. But now it seemed like she had fallen into some deep trouble.</p><p>“Qiao Nian?”</p><p>She was busy catching up with the man when she heard a familiar and shocked voice.</p><p></p><p></p><p>She looked up and saw a group of people standing in the dim area.</p><p>Qiao Weimin, Mother Qiao, Qiao Chen, and Old Madam Qiao were all standing around there.</p><p>Besides the Qiao family, Fu Ge and Madam Fu were around too. There two other women by the side in traditional outfits and the younger one had her arm hooked around the older one. The older woman had a head of white hair and a jade-beaded necklace. Her red dress emphasized her elegance and class. She was now turning to talk to the people around her, seemingly asking who Qiao Nian was.</p><p>The Qiao family members had interesting expressions upon seeing Qiao Nian.</p><p></p><p></p><p>“What are you doing here?” Qiao Weimin approached her in quick strides. His voice was low, but there was a hint of frustration in it.</p><p>When Qiao Nian rejected his money, he still felt that she had an admirable character. Who knew that she actually followed them all the way here!</p><p>Qiao Chen was going to formally be an apprentice to a master. The Fu family members were there to witness it as well. Qiao Weimin didn’t want her to make things ugly later on, so he suppressed his anger and said, “Nian Nian, your mom and grandma and I didn’t chase you out. It was you who chose to put your information online in search of your biological parents. Now that you’ve found them, why are you here to cause trouble again?”</p><p>He’d thought that Qiao Nian overheard their appointment at Waterside Loft and decided to come along as well.</p><p>He didn’t see Ye Wangchuan when he took his wallet out and asked, “Did you think it through and decide that you still want the ten thousand yuan?”</p><p>He looked for the bank card in his wallet, all ready to hand it to her.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Nian looked at how impatient he looked and was about to say something.</p><p>But before she said a word, a hand reached across her and slipped the bank card back into Qiao Weimin’s wallet. The man’s hand then grabbed hers and he said, “Let’s go, Grandpa Ye is waiting for you.”</p><p>Qiao Nian was stunned for a moment. Anyone who knew her would know that she hated others touching her. The last time someone did that, she beat that person up and caused him to lie in hospital for three whole months.</p><p>She could feel his warm palm on her hand and was hyper-aware of the sweat from his touch. She looked up at him.</p><p>Did he really need to touch her!</p><p>Qiao Nian thought of shaking him off but chose to swallow her words when she realized that the Qiao family was still watching.</p><p>She couldn’t even be bothered to look at Qiao Weimin again.</p><p>She simply went “Mm” and, under the watchful eyes of the Qiaos, headed into the private room with him.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The Qiaos were in shock.</p><p>Waterside Loft was different from other restaurants; it was way more popular and difficult to get a table here. They had had to pull strings in order to get a reservation for tonight, and all they got was an ordinary cubicle. The one that Qiao Nian and the young man went into was a private room.</p><p>That said enough about their difference in status!</p>
