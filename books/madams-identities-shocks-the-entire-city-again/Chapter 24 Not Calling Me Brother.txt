Your sister was barely admitted to Class B, but your grades can’t make it to Class A either. Instead of being assigned to a bad class like Class S, why don’t you just go to a different place? It’s not worth it to force yourself if you belong somewhere else…”</p><p>Qiao Nian waited patiently for him to finish. “Are you done? Who told you that I’ll only study in Class S?”</p><p></p><p></p><p>“You think you can get into Class A?!” Qiao Weimin didn’t take it seriously and couldn’t hold himself back. “… Nian Nian, I’m doing this for your own good!”</p><p>“You’re doing it for Qiao Chen!” Qiao Nian’s eyes dripped with indifference. “Did Qiao Chen tell you that she doesn’t want to go to the same school as me?”</p><p>“Chen Chen never said so.”</p><p>In fact, Qiao Chen had tactfully suggested that she didn’t want Qiao Nian to attend Rao City’s First High School before.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Nian tore off his hypocritical mask directly and said bluntly, “I won’t change schools. If Qiao Chen doesn’t want to be in the same school as me, you can ask her to change schools.”</p><p>“Qiao Nian!” Qiao Weimin yelled furiously at her disobedience. “Your sister isn’t in good health and has finally adapted to the school environment. What are you talking about…”</p><p>“I’m just telling the truth.”</p><p>Qiao Nian didn’t care about his anger. “She’s recommended a spot in Ren Yi anyway, and her college entrance examination score isn’t important. The elite’s boarding is so good and suits her. If she wants to study there, just let her. As for me… I won’t bother you!”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Since her phone was still ringing, she didn’t bother arguing with him and simply bypassed him. “I have something else to attend to. I’ll leave first.”</p><p>Qiao Weimin’s face turned green with anger. He watched as her back disappeared in the lobby on the first floor, and a man at the corner of the corridor came down to pick her up.</p><p>His expression became increasingly unsightly.</p><p>But he maintained his composure and restrained himself from catching up with Qiao Nian and continuing to argue with her in public. He could only walk away, for now, thinking in his heart that he must find a good time to talk to her again.</p><p>He happened to bump into Jiang Li outside. Jiang Li’s appearance was so outstanding that he couldn’t help but take another look.</p><p>He seemed to have seen his face on TV before. He was a star and seemed quite famous!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Why was a star at Rao City’s hospital?</p><p>Could it be that a show was being filmed here?</p><p>…</p><p>At the staircase.</p><p>Ye Wangchuan went to the ward to check on Ye Qichen, who was now out of danger but still unconscious. After calling Qiao Nian for a long time and yet not seeing her come up, he had no choice but to come down to find her.</p><p>His eyes fell on the drenched and fragile-looking girl.</p><p>“Why didn’t you answer the phone?”</p><p>Too lazy to explain her encounter with the Qiao family, Qiao Nian replied casually, “My phone is on silent mode. I didn’t see your call.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ye Wangchuan saw that her phone was still vibrating out of the corner of his eye, and also noticed her silently hanging up. However, he didn’t expose her lie.</p><p>He reached out to pull her. “Let’s go, Grandpa Jiang and the others are waiting for you.”</p><p>Qiao Nian avoided his hand agilely with a depressed expression.</p><p>Jiang Li must have called them!</p><p>Her neck was just a little scratched, what was there to alert everyone about!</p><p>She was about to go up when she was suddenly blocked in a corner.</p><p>Ye Wangchuan’s tall figure cast a shadow that shrouded her like a mountain.</p><p>The invisible strength and pressure coming from him made Qiao Nian’s goosebumps stand.</p><p>“You’re not calling me brother?”</p><p>His voice was sexy and sultry!</p><p>It took her breath away!</p><p>What was he saying!</p><p>Qiao Nian raised her head questioningly, staring into his vast and deep eyes. Bloodthirsty hostility was suppressed under his dark eyes as he stared at her as if sucking her in.</p><p></p><p></p><p>“I’ll take you up.”</p><p>He forcefully held her hand, his thin lips pursed into a slight smile. He was wanton and unbridled, and his big hand completely wrapped her hand as if he wouldn’t allow her to break free.</p><p>Then, he gathered his seductive aura and returned to looking lazy and indifferent. “Let’s go.”</p>
