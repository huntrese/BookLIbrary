<p></p><p></p><p> "…huh? You're married, Victor?" Edward spoke as he looked at me with a shocked face. </p><p> "Yes," I answered honestly. </p><p> Edward's gaze shifted to a look as if I'd made the biggest mistake of my life… </p><p> "Marriage is not a good thing, Victor... But if you're happy, I'm supportive." He spoke while shaking a little, he seemed to remember bad things from the past. </p><p> "Pfft," Andrew started to laugh. </p><p> I looked at Andrew who was laughing, "Stop laughing! And why did he react that way?" I asked. </p><p> He held back his laugh and said, "Oh, you didn't know, right? A few years ago, Andrew tried to marry a woman, but she was the jealous and stalking type and, because of that, he has emotional scars from what happened." </p><p> I see Edward shiver a little when he hears Andrew talk about what happened. </p><p> "But aren't they the best women?" I replied without understanding. </p><p> "Huh?" </p><p> "Huh?" </p><p> "Meow?" Even Zack, who was a little distant, meowed aloud. </p><p> I looked confused at Andrew and Edward who were looking at me as if they had seen an exotic creature. </p><p> Edward puts his hand to his face like he has a headache, and asks me, "Do you have a head problem?" </p><p> "Huh?" Now I was the one who didn't understand. </p><p> "From the expression, he's making it's obvious that he really doesn't understand his problem," Andrew spoke as Edward nodded. </p><p> Then Edward speaks, "Listen, Victor. Jealous and stalking women are the worst kind of women. Don't go near them, or you'll get killed!" </p><p> "I don't understand what you're saying, if you accept her feelings won't everything be okay? Why should I care?" I asked really confused. </p><p> "...." </p><p> They were silently looking at me with their mouths open in shock. </p><p> "He's a lost cause… Come to think of it, he's always been like that, huh? He always picked the craziest women." Andrew spoke as if thinking of the past. </p><p> "Coming to think of it... That's true," Edward said, then he continued, "Has he never heard that he should never date a crazy woman?" </p><p> "Wait!" Leona suddenly screamed as she looked at Edward and Andrew. </p><p> "Are you just going to ignore that he just said he got married!?" she spoke as she knocked on the table. </p><p> "Oh, that's true," Edward said. </p><p> "Who is your wife? Do you have a picture of her?" Andrew asked and, hearing Andrew's question, Leona and Edward looked at me. </p><p> "Hmm, I do," Actually, I had pictures of Violet and Sasha. I didn't take these pictures, it seems like Natalia was making a photo album or something, so, she took some pictures and sent me to my phone. </p><p> I never understood this maid, she always seems to be hidden, but when I call her she always appears; she is like a ghost... </p><p> I pull out my cell phone and show Violet's photo. </p><p> Andrew whistled: "She's hot-" </p><p> I looked at Andrew with an emotionless expression. "Keep talking... And I promise you tomorrow you'll wake up in New York Bay, I bet the fish will love to eat you." </p><p> I saw Andrew's body shake a little, he replied. "It's just a joke, and you wouldn't do it, right?" </p><p> I keep looking at him with an emotionless gaze. </p><p> "Right?" I saw Andrew's expression darken a little in fear. </p><p> "You know I always keep my promises," I said in a dry tone. To be honest, I wouldn't do that, he's a good friend and I wouldn't kill my friend just for that; but he would get hit a little. </p><p> Edward touched Andrew's shoulder and said, "Remember the Brothers code." </p><p> "Yes, I know," Andrew said in a serious tone. </p><p> "Victor wouldn't dump you in New York Bay, but he would probably hit you, and I think he's more capable of defending himself with his current body," Edward continued. </p><p> Suddenly, Leona appears in front of me and takes my cell phone, I look at her confused, then she flips the image to the side and sees Sasha's photo. </p><p> "Who is she?" She asked in a neutral tone. </p><p> "Oh, she's my second wife." </p><p> "..." </p><p> My three friends look at me with the most shocked face I've ever seen in my life, if this was an anime I bet their mouths would be on the ground by now. </p><p> "Hold the balls of the donkey!" Andrew practically yelled, he approaches Leona and looks at the image of Sasha on the phone. </p><p> I see Leona's eyebrow twitch a little in annoyance, but she's silent. </p><p> I see Edward approaching, and he also sees Sasha's photo. </p><p> "Hmm, I don't know how to react to that, when did you become a chad?" Edward spoke in a tired tone. </p><p> I see my cat climbing on Edward's shoulder and looking at Sasha's picture, then he looks at me and meows as he raises his paw: "Meow." </p><p> He seemed to be praising me or something. </p><p> "W-Wait," Leona looked quite shaken, she looks at me and asks, "Do they know about each other!?" </p><p> "Yes, of course," I replied. </p><p> "..." </p><p> "Damn, Victor... You made quite a catch, I never thought I would say that, but I'm proud of you." Edward spoke as he held back the tears from his eyes; somehow I could tell he was jealous, but at the same time, he was scared. </p><p> "Ed, you don't understand! You know our friend here, right? Do you think he's a man to chase after another woman if he's married!? He's not me!" Andrew practically screamed. </p><p> Bruh, you mustn't say that about yourself with pride. </p><p> "Coming to think about it, you're right," Edward said. </p><p> "Yes, Victor is a very loyal man," Leona said and the three looked at me. </p><p> "Well, to be honest, they're the ones who came after me," I replied with a happy little smile. </p><p> "..." </p><p> The three of them look at me with dead fish eyes, Leona said, "You know you can't marry more than one person in this country, right?" </p><p> "I know." I nod my head in agreement, but human law means nothing to vampires. </p><p> "Question." Andrew raised his hand like he was a child who wanted to ask the teacher a question. </p><p> "What?" </p><p> "Do your wives get angry when other women approach you? Do they suddenly have tantrums? Are they very jealous?" </p><p> I look at Andrew shocked, "How did you know that?" </p><p> "Bruh," Andrew replied, he looked at Edward and Leona, "Now everything makes sense." </p><p> Edward nodded and he looks at me with a dead fish look, "RIP, Buddy... I think soon, we'll be going to your funeral." </p><p> "Huh!?" </p><p> "Brother, don't gamble on Victor!" Leona spoke irritated, then she continued, "What if he really dies!?" </p><p> "Why are you thinking I'm going to die?" I asked as soon all my friends looked at me in shock even my cat looked at me. </p><p> "You're dating two Yanderes, buddy…" Andrew said. </p><p> "Yandere?" I questioned the word I didn't know. </p><p> "Do you remember that pink-haired girl anime that we watched in our teens?" </p><p> "Oh, I remember I thought she was pretty at the time, what about her?" I asked. </p><p> I saw Edward, Leona, and Andrew's faces tremble as they heard my words. </p><p> "She is a yandere." </p><p> "I see... And you're saying my wives are just like her?" </p><p> "Yes." </p><p> "Isn't that a good thing?" I blurted out, after all, I don't know what the word 'yandere' means, but Violet and Sasha are adorable, and that's all that matters. </p><p> "...." </p><p> Sigh! Sigh! Sigh! </p><p> The three sighed at the same time, and it looks like they've given up on something. </p><p> "Just don't die, okay? And don't cheat on your wives, or you'll die" </p><p> "I would never do that, why should I cheat on my wives if I have such beautiful wives?" </p><p> "Sigh, if you didn't have a screw loose in your head, you'd be a good man." Leona sighed. </p><p> Edward looked at his sister with serious eyes. "I won't allow it! Absolutely not! You'll never get married while I'm alive!" </p><p> "Brother!" Leona cried out in embarrassment. </p><p> "There's Edward Siscon," Andrew said laughing. </p><p> "Siscon?" I asked confused. </p><p> Leona, Andrew, and Edward looked at me as if I had done something wrong. </p><p> Andrew says, "You're an uncultured man, buddy. We need to sort this out." </p><p> "Huh!?" </p><p> "Well don't judge him too much, he's a movie man; I remember his dad likes watching movies, he must have been influenced." Leona helped me. </p><p> "Heretic," Edward said. </p><p> "Coming to think about it, he's only watched two animes in his life, huh?" Andrew spoke. </p><p> "Unforgivable," Edward said. </p><p> "Hmm, it was the one anime with the alien that gets stronger and his hair changes color, and the pink-haired Yandere's anime," Leona said. </p><p> "Yes, I remember you recommended it to him at the time," Andrew said. </p><p> "Indeed." Leona nodded. </p><p> Suddenly, my cell phone started ringing, Leona looks at my cell phone and says, "Kaguya?" </p><p> "Oh, she's my wife's maid." </p><p> "M-Maid...?" Leona spoke in a stutter. </p><p> I hold out my hand and Leona nods as she hands me the cell. </p><p> I answer my cell phone and start talking to Kaguya. </p><p> While Victor was on the phone talking to Kaguya, his friends were whispering in a not-so-low voice. </p><p> "Did he just say M-Maid?" Leona spoke. </p><p> "Why are you stuttering?" Andrew asked curiously. </p><p> "Idiot, hiring a maid is expensive, did you know?" Leona spoke. </p><p> "Oh, I didn't know," Andrew said. </p><p> "I think his wife is rich," Edward deduced. </p><p> "Isn't he very lucky?" Andrew can't help but speak out loud. </p><p> Leona and Edward look at Andrew confused. </p><p> Andrew begins to explain, "He married two wives, and one of those wives is rich, and both wives are beautiful." </p><p> "Oh, you're right, but it's not all flowers, they're yanderes, you know? He could die at any time," Edward explained as he shivered a little. </p><p> "Hmm, I think Victor will be fine," Leona said, now that she was calmer, she could think better about the whole situation. </p><p> "What do you mean?" Edward asked. </p><p> "Remember how Victor's personality is, he may not realize it, but he knows how to treat a woman well. I think his mother's teachings influenced him without him realizing it and he became a natural playboy." Leona would never say that the headpats Victor gave were good too, she would never speak it out loud! Never! </p><p> "And he doesn't refuse Yandere's advances, so I think he's safe? The protagonists only die in the anime because he refused women's advances, after all, most of these protagonists were beta men." Leona said. </p><p> "Hmm, you're right," Andrew said. </p><p> "Victor likes crazy women, huh?" Edward spoke out loud, he looked confused. </p><p> "Just in case, I'll keep in touch with a friend of mine from the police, after all, stalking is a criminal act," Andrew said. </p><p> "Oh, now that I think of it, in real life the act of stalking someone is a crime," Leona said. </p><p> "Leona, you are watching too many animes," Edward scolded her lightly. </p><p> "Brother, I can't leave the house because of my skin, what do you think I should do? Look for a boyfriend?" </p><p> "Absolutely not! I will buy more animes for you! So stay home!" </p><p> "Humpf," Leona huffed and turned her face away, but Andrew could see she had a smile as if it was all part of her plan. </p><p> Victor ended his call and said, "I'm going home." </p><p> I look at Zack and say, "Hey, Zack. Let's go, buddy." </p><p> "Meow," Zack who was lying on a chair gets up, walks slowly towards me, and climbs on my shoulder then I put my hand behind to hold him, and he lies down on my shoulder. </p><p> "…Are you absolutely sure he's not a dog? Or a monkey? How can a cat be so smart?" Leona asked in disbelief, I also see Andrew and Edward nodding. </p><p> "He's normal, he's just used to being that way, after all, I've raised him from a young age," I replied. </p><p> "...." Leona is silent and decides not to argue anymore, she just sighs as if she had given up on something. </p><p> Edward looks at me, "What happened? You look happy," </p><p> "Oh my wife met my other wife today, because of that I'm happy," I answered honestly. </p><p> My three friends look at me with dark faces and I realize Edward was shaking a little too. </p><p> "Two Yandere will meet…" Andrew swallows hard, and sighs as he looks at me with respect, "How can I say, Victor you are a man among men." </p><p> "Thanks?" I reply, confused. </p><p> "Anyway, I'll see you guys later." I spoke as I turned around </p><p> "Bye, Victor. Try not to die, Buddy," Edward said. </p><p> "Take care of yourself, Victor," Andrew said, he looked like he wasn't going to follow me anymore. </p><p> Leona didn't say anything, she just waved at me. </p><p> .... </p>
