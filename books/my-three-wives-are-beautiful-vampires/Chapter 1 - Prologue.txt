<p></p><p></p><p>I open my eyes, seeing a familiar ceiling, and turn my face to look at my computer that was on my personal desk, "When did I get home?" rising from my bed I start to think. My memories were scrambled and I couldn't remember anything...</p><p>"Victor!!" Suddenly I hear a woman's voice. It was an angelic voice, a wonderfully beautiful voice; and she sounded very worried.</p><p>"Ugh... Who?" I put a hand to my head when I feel it start hurting badly.</p><p>I lean on the bed and try to get up, but all of a sudden I feel my hand sinking into the material of the bed. I hear the noise of wood breaking and look in the direction of my hand; I see that my hand has gone through the mattress and broke the wood that supports my bed...</p><p>I quickly pulled my hand away and I looked, confused, at my mattress that had a hole in it "What's wrong with me?" I asked aloud, stunned.</p><p>I don't remember being so strong; did something happen to me? I start to question myself, and I try to search my memory. But, even though I try to search my memory, I can't find it; it's like something is blocking my memories.</p><p>I try to form a coherent train of thought as if I'm putting together a puzzle, "Let's start at the beginning, I went to the grocery store to buy the food my mom ordered, but..."</p><p>I try to continue to form a timeline with my memories, but I don't have time for that when I feel unbearable thirst in my throat. It was like I ran a marathon and needed a drink of water! My throat was parched!</p><p>I quickly get up, ignoring the sounds of wood creaking from the floor and grab my bathroom door handle, attempting to open the door, but something amazing happens...</p><p>The door is literally ripped off the wall. I was shocked at this show of force but I don't have time to admire it, or even question how I was able to do it. I quickly walk into the bathroom and try to turn on the water tap.</p><p>As before, the tap broke when I tried to open it and the water started to spew out; I ignored it, and put my mouth into the water trying to drink as much as possible. I looked like a man who was lost in the desert and found an oasis for the first time in days.</p><p>I feel the cold water from the tap entering my mouth and seeping down my throat, but the water doesn't seem to satisfy me; I needed more. I needed something to satisfy my thirst, the water didn't seem to be working.</p><p>"Calm down," I hear a woman's voice, it was the same voice that called my name when I woke up.</p><p>Suddenly, as if it were a misleading lie, the thirst I had been feeling earlier disappeared.</p><p>I fall to the ground and start to inhale and breathe heavily, "Who's there?" I asked out loud, but I didn't hear an answer. I take a deep breath and sigh, "Just what in the name of God is happening?"</p><p>I look at the overflowing water and realize I couldn't leave it like this. I carefully turned off another valve that was located near the floor and soon the water stopped pouring.</p><p>I sigh in relief and get up off the floor. I turn to look at myself in the mirror, and what I see surprises me: "Is that … me?"</p><p>I look a little taller, I have a well defined body with muscles in the right places, six-pack abs and muscular arms. What stood out the most in my appearance is the incredibly pale skin, it's like I'm missing most of the blood in my body. I used to look like a dead creature from a disease that gave me anemia, an extremely inconvenient disease and in some cases deadly... But, this is another level... I look like I don't have any blood in my body, I also noticed that my face is more defined; and my blue eyes and black hair have gained more shine?</p><p>Did the former 21-year-old who was skinny and looked like a teenager, grow up to be an athletic looking man in just one night? What happened? Was I kidnapped by the government and drafted into the super soldier program?</p><p>"Victor, what's going on? Why all the noise?" I look towards where I hear another voice and I start to breathe heavily; my throat starts to get thirsty again. I look through the wall and see the image of a human, and I can see her heart beating in a very attractive rhythm...</p><p>I could see the person's entire body with a red vision, it was like the world around me had changed; and I could see the heart that was glowing a more vibrant red. It was like it was inviting me to rip it out ... and drink it.</p><p>"Victor? What's happening? What was that noise?" Hearing my mother's voice, I woke up from my inebriated state.</p><p>"M-Mother...?" I responded in the most normal voice I could muster; but, it was obvious that I failed.</p><p>"Victor!? Open the door, what's going on?" I look at my reflection in the mirror and notice that my eyes have changed to blood red.</p><p>"Oh... Shit."</p><p>Realizing what happened to me changed me in many different ways, I started to think rationally. I try with all my strength to resist the temptation to leave the room and rip my mother's heart out.</p><p>First, I must calm my mother down and get her out of here.</p><p>"Mom, I'm busy right now."</p><p>Realizing I was speaking normally again, she visibly calms; at least that's what my new red vision implies. I can't see her expression but I can see her heart beating at a slower pace.</p><p>"Can you open the door?"</p><p>"I can't…I'm not wearing clothes right now", I said in an uncomfortable voice.</p><p>"Oh," She suddenly turns and starts heading towards the stairs. I was confused for a moment, why did she give up so easily?</p><p>"Make sure you take out your trash; I don't want to clean your fluids, that's your girlfriend's job. If you have one of course."</p><p>Oof, I feel an arrow in my chest for some reason but, strangely, it helped me calm down. I grow a little smile; my mother has no mercy and speaks her mind, she's very honest. That's the quality I like most about her. Though, I won't deny that I am often irritated with her honesty; but living 21 years of my life under her roof, you get used to it.</p><p>Anyway, I look at the clock and see that it's morning. I need to go to college, but I don't think I'm able to go out on the street right now, and...</p><p>I look at my room and see the mess I made, the floor was broken, the door was ripped out, the bathroom was flooded... "I need to organize this mess"</p><p>...</p><p>Two hours later.</p><p>When tidying my room, I found out several things about my new self. I had more strength, much more strength than I had previously.</p><p>Because of this change, I'm having trouble controlling myself. Before I used X force and I could open my bedroom door without breaking anything, but if I use the same force now, the bedroom door will literally be ripped off the wall.</p><p>My senses like hearing, smelling, sight, etc. They're much more sensitive, my hearing isn't on the level of the comic book scout friend who wears blue and red and has the S symbol on his chest; that guy could hear the entire planet...</p><p>As far as I've tested, I can hear everything that's going on in my house and in the surrounding neighborhood. It's annoying, I hear multiple voices at the same time and I can't discern who's who.</p><p>Because of that, I tried something. I focused all my attention on a porn video that I opened on my computer called 'The hardest game in the world'.</p><p>Do I look stupid? Yes, but it worked. Men are easy creatures to grab attention from.</p><p>My sense of smell has also improved, but the only thing I can smell from several kilometers away is blood, I can't differentiate the scents either.</p><p>Another thing I learned is that I have another kind of vision. When I switch to this vision, the world turns red and I can see everything around as if there were no walls. And, in this world, I can see human silhouettes. When I focus on these beings, I can see their hearts glowing bright red.</p><p>I just tested this for a few seconds; I don't want to risk getting thirsty again.</p><p>And yes... I know shit happened to me... I became a vampire, or something like a vampire...</p><p>The features are very obvious, pale skin, red eyes, better physical conditioning, and an insatiable thirst...</p><p>Knowing this, I have a starting line in my reasoning.</p><p>First, let's see what weaknesses I have.</p><p>The most obvious weaknesses from vampire books are garlic, the cross of Jesus (or something related to god), sunlight, and I can't enter someone's house uninvited. Also ... running water?</p><p>Some weaknesses may seem stupid, but I need to test them all. First the cross of Jesus. I look at a necklace that is hanging on my computer screen, on that necklace there is a cross; I slowly touch the necklace and I feel ... nothing.</p><p>Hmm, next. Running water... Well, I drank tap water, I guess that counts as a no? I don't know. I need to go to a pool or river that has running water and test; let's leave this weakness for another time.</p><p>Next on the list is garlic, I remember I bought garlic pizza two days ago. I walk towards the small fridge in my room and pick up the garlic pizza I had bought. Smelling the pizza with my nose, I feel like throwing up, but I also don't feel anything else; like a sudden weakness or something.</p><p>I think the urge to vomit was because my appetite changed? I try to put the pizza in my mouth and as expected, my body instantly rejects the food.</p><p>I ran towards the bathroom and spit the pizza into the toilet.</p><p>"How disgusting," I said with a nauseous face, "Why do I feel like I've eaten an out-of-date fish?"</p><p>My stomach churns, and I feel like throwing up. I quickly started to inhale and take deep breaths, a few minutes later repeating this process, the urge to vomit passed.</p><p>In the future, I must test whether whole garlic has any effect on me. Thinking about it now, that was stupid... What kind of vampire would have weakness to garlic pizza?</p><p>Anyway, the next weakness is the sun...</p><p>I walk towards my bedroom window, which is located on the wall where my bed is positioned; I climb onto my bed and open a small gap in the curtain for the sunlight to enter.</p><p>I swallow my saliva, I am a little scared of disappearing. After all, the biggest weakness of vampires is sunlight, but, I need to know; and I think just putting my finger in the sun shouldn't cause any problems, right?</p><p>Slowly, I bring my finger closer to the sunlight. When there was only 1CM left until sunlight touched my finger, I stopped... No, I need to know; don't be a chicken, Victor!</p><p>I put my finger in the sunlight and... nothing happens. I don't feel my finger disappear, and I don't feel that intense pain that I expected...</p><p>I sigh in relief, I look at my window curtain and open it. As soon as the sunlight enters my room, I feel the sun bathing me in warmth and touching my entire body; yet, I feel nothing.</p><p>For some reason, I felt like I should praise the sun right now, but I'm not going to do that. What if someone saw me?</p><p>I lie down on the bed and look up at the ceiling. "With no other obvious vampire weaknesses, I don't want to try to decapitate myself or rip my heart out; I'm not crazy enough for that."</p><p>"... What am I?" I say to myself out loud. This morning was weird. For some reason, I don't remember what happened yesterday and I woke up with the characteristics of a vampire. But, I also didn't have the obvious weaknesses of a vampire... Am I reading too many books?</p><p>"But, Hey, at least I don't glow in the sunlight." I laugh at my own lame joke. I close my eyes, and slowly, I drift off to sleep.</p>
