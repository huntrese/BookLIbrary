<p></p><p></p><p>February 2nd, the day after Victor discovered the changes in his body.</p><p>I was walking towards my house with Violet clinging to my arm with a really big smile on her face. Currently, only one thing concerns me.</p><p>How the hell am I going to explain the changes in my body to my mom?</p><p>I look into the mirrored window of a building next to me. I was 175CM before I became a vampire, I was a very thin young man who looked very anemic, but when I became a vampire I grew 5CM in height.</p><p>I'm 180 cm tall now with more defined muscles that stand out a little in the outfit I'm wearing. My pale skin has turned a paler shade than it was before, while my black hair and blue eyes have taken on a brighter shade. Overall, I looked the same as before, with the only differences being that my body grew and my skin turned paler.</p><p>By the way, I was wearing casual clothes, a loose black shirt and black pants along with white sneakers from a famous brand.</p><p>Violet was wearing a black dress, it was a closed-neck sleeveless dress made of leather. The dress was a little short, reaching up to her beautiful thighs almost showing the flesh of her ass. For a moment I think I actually drooled, it was very sexy, especially glued to her body with her perfect curves.</p><p>When she saw my gaze she displayed a seductive smile as if everything went according to plan.</p><p>According to my wife Violet...the vampire transformation forces the body to its peak state and, as I am a newborn, these changes will only stop happening when my body is fully developed. She said that usually, it takes a week for the body to stop constantly evolving.</p><p>I look at the clock on my phone and it's currently seven in the morning. Normally this wasn't the time for vampires to be awake, but Violet and I were special so we just looked like a tourist couple from the North Pole or from some other area of the coldest parts of the planet, although I don't know if civilization exists at the North Pole.</p><p>Why do Violet and I look like tourists? Well, our pale skin color draws a lot of attention and, to my limited knowledge, humans who live in snowy areas of the planet tend to have paler skin color (I think? I'm not sure, I wasn't the brightest student in geography at school). Anyway, we look like two tourists who have come from a very cold place. After all, no one would believe that two vampires are walking around in broad daylight.</p><p>When Violet and I stopped at a location that she was interested in, the salesperson asked if I was a tourist, and I said yes, I also said that we lived in a really icy area.</p><p>Surprisingly, he agreed with my words easily. Well I live in the United States Of America so I guess tourists around here are normal?</p><p>And Violet? I look at my wife, she seems to be having fun, she seems to consider walking back to my house as some sort of date or something. Apparently, she hasn't left the house for a few years, (she told me this by accident) and, because of that, she's curious about everything. She looks like a curious kitten, if anything catches her attention she stops walking and moves toward it, then, if she finds something interesting, she buys it and asks Kaguya, who is accompanying us, to take it. She was like a princess who went to the mall and bought everything she saw and liked… Rich people are different...</p><p>It wasn't until Kaguya came out into the sun that I found out she was from the same family as Violet. Apparently, she's from a family dedicated to serving Violet's family; she didn't explain much to me about it.</p><p>An interesting thing about Kaguya is that she is a vampire who only inherited immunity to the sun, she doesn't have control of Violet's fire element.</p><p>She seems to have an ability called 'shadows'; basically she becomes one with a shadow and can walk in the shadows... This is a very broken skill, she can pretty much kill anyone at night.</p><p>"Ugh, Lady Violet. You are buying too many things, the thin arms of this helpless young woman can't take it. I wonder if there is any man who can help me?" Kaguya spoke in a neutral tone as she looked at me with bright eyes.</p><p>Who do you think you are kidding, woman? You? Helpless? Is this some kind of joke?</p><p>I just turn my face away and ignore Kaguya.</p><p>"Tsk"</p><p>Did I hear a 'Tsk' just now? Shouldn't this woman be calm and cool or something? Is her mask falling off?</p><p>"Hahaha, I'm glad you're getting along with Kaguya, but…" Violet looks at Kaguya, "Don't get too close, okay?"</p><p>She spoke with an emotionless face, I could see it was just a simple warning, but that it contained many meanings I didn't understand.</p><p>"Yes. Don't worry, Lady Violet. I take my job very seriously." Kaguya spoke in a neutral tone that carried unshakable confidence.</p><p>Kaguya looked a little nervous.</p><p>I stroked Violet's hair: "Let's keep walking, help me think of a way to fool my mom."</p><p>Suddenly, Violet becomes more docile, and says: "Yes!"</p><p>I look at Kaguya with a smug face, Kaguya just turns away and ignores me.</p><p>Seriously. Where is Violet's family finding these interesting people? It's been a while since I've had fun like this, I thought with a smile on my face.</p><p>"Darling, why don't you charm your mother?" Violet spoke suddenly.</p><p>"Oh, are you talking about that skill from the movies? Do I look at someone, and tell them to do whatever I want?"</p><p>"Yes," Violet nods her head as she continues walking with me. "You don't need to do a very difficult one just something like, 'Ignore the changes in my appearance'"</p><p>To be honest, I was inclined to do that, but I feel it would give me a bad taste in my mouth to charm my family. Hmm? I look to the side and see police cars speeding past.</p><p>Vrummm! Vrummm!</p><p>The police were chasing a truck and, just for a few moments, I sensed a familiar smell. I decided this was a good opportunity to test my new senses, I take the cheap black glasses I bought and put them on my face (the glasses only cost 5 dollars), they were very big and unfashionable glasses and the lenses appeared to be very dark too, I bought these glasses for one reason only.</p><p>When I use my red vision my eyes change to blood red, to avoid drawing attention, I bought some big black glasses. After all, even though I'm wearing glasses, I can still see with this special vision.</p><p>I switch to my red vision, and soon my world turns red, I focus my vision on the truck and realize there are 20 vampires inside the vehicle.</p><p>"20 vampires, huh?" I spoke in a low voice.</p><p>"Can you see that far?" Violet asked, a little shocked. She could do the same, she could look at things far away like she was looking very close, but my vision was more stable, and it wasn't affected by visible obstacles like buildings, houses, metal walls, etc...</p><p>This was a good skill for reconnaissance.</p><p>"Yes. I think those are Lucy's subordinates?" I spoke in a disinterested tone. I said it because I smelled the old vampire stench from those vampires that were in the truck; I only smelled it for a few seconds, but it was enough to recognize them.</p><p>"Hmm, he's getting a lot of attention, if he's not killed by the Inquisition, he'll die by the claws of noble vampires." Violet spoke in a non-caring tone, she probably has some of her people looking into this matter.</p><p>Suddenly Violet stops walking and looks at a big bear that was being sold in a children's store... Just out of curiosity, I looked at the price of the bear, and it cost 25 thousand dollars, what the fuck!?</p><p>Isn't that just a bear? How is it so expensive!?</p><p>Violet suddenly starts running at the speed of a normal human girl, and enters the store.</p><p>Seeing Violet buying the bear and hugging it, I can't help but say... She's adorable, damn!</p><p>"Kaguya, why are the nobles going to kill Lucy?"</p><p>Kaguya, who was carrying Violet's bags, spoke in the same neutral tone. "It's because he broke the rules."</p><p>Kaguya looks at me and says: "Rule number four of being a vampire, never reveal that you are a vampire to humans; matters involving the vampire world should not be mixed with human affairs… This rule can be ignored if the vampire is contacting a human with the intention of turning the same human into a vampire."</p><p>"If he breaks this rule, he'll be hunted by the Nobles and killed. After all, we don't like to draw too much attention"</p><p>Said the woman who was dressed as a maid while carrying several purchases; if that's not attracting attention, what is? But, I understood what she was saying, this rule was basically a warning to younger vampires: 'Don't make too much of a fuss about vampires, or we'll go after you.'</p><p>They were basically saying that.</p><p>Soon Violet comes back carrying a big bear and with a happy face, I can't help but pat her head when I see her like this.</p><p>Feeling my caresses, she shows a happy smile, then I say: "Come on, we're almost there"</p><p>The two women nod in agreement.</p><p>...</p><p>Arriving at my house, I open the door.</p><p>"Mom, I'm home!" I spoke out loud.</p><p>"Victor!? Son, why didn't you answer the phone!? I was getting—" She trails off as she looks at me standing in the doorway along with two women.</p><p>"Victor...?" She approaches me suspiciously.</p><p>I look at my mom. She's going to be 40 this year; she has a little belly fat but, overall, her appearance is well preserved, long black hair, blue eyes and a curvy body. She keeps saying that lawyers who look good have a better chance of getting rich clients.</p><p>My mother's clients in the past were politicians with questionable résumés, they called these politicians 'fat lambs' and she defended these politicians in exchange for large amounts of money. She not only defended politicians, she defended normal people and even companies that had suffered because of fraud, etc. She's a good lawyer, even if she defended corrupt politicians, in the end, it doesn't matter.</p><p>After all, work is work, does she defend corrupt politicians? Yes, but the money is good, and she's not doing anything illegal, even though she stopped doing it a long time ago (it was getting dangerous to work in that world), because of that decision she made in the past, she doesn't win as much money as she had before.</p><p>"Strange…" She spoke with a confused face, then she continued: "I feel that you are my son, but at the same time, I feel that you have changed too much to be my son." She is still honest as always, she was standing in front of me looking at me with a face that said 'you can't fool me'.</p><p>"Sigh, when I was 13, you and I went out to a restaurant; we met your ex-friend, that woman you called 'Thot'," I started to speak.</p><p>"What is her name?" She asked.</p><p>"Aphrodite" I know her name is Renata, but my mom dubbed her Aphrodite.</p><p>"That is still not enough!" She spoke as if she hadn't lost a battle or something like that.</p><p>"On my 21st birthday, you took me outside a brothel and said you'd dump me in that place if I didn't find a girlfriend."</p><p>Violet suddenly looked at my mom for a moment, she seemed undecided about what to do; her eyes were glowing dangerously, but soon the light seemed to fade, it looked like she was going through an internal conflict.</p><p>Cough!</p><p>My mother pretended to cough:</p><p>"Yes, you are definitely my son. By the way, you shouldn't say that out loud. What will people think of me if they find out I almost gave away my son's cherry just because I wanted my son to have a girlfriend?" She spoke with a snort.</p><p>My eyes start to twitch when I hear what my mom says, but I can't help but smile in happiness. My mom is weird but she's a good mom, she's not 'normal' like all moms of the world, but she is my mother and I love her very much as a son.</p><p>She approaches me and says: "You're paler than usual, do you need food? And it looks like you've grown too." she puts her hand on her head and starts trying to measure my height by comparing her height with mine</p><p>My mother's height is around 170 CM, she is a little shorter than my old height before being turned into a vampire which was 175 CM.</p><p>"It's puberty, mom" I said the excuse every man ever has told his mother at least once in his life.</p><p>"Puberty...?" She repeated what I said with distrust.</p><p>She looks at Violet and Kaguya.</p><p>Seeing how beautiful both women were, my mother started to enter her own world again.</p><p>"Holy shit!! You popped your cherry and because of it you grew!? Kyaa! Wait a moment! I'll call your father!" Suddenly she starts running towards the stairs, she puts both hands close to her mouth like she has to call someone.</p><p>"Leon!! Get down here immediately!! I mean it!! Get your lazy, fat belly down here now!!" she screamed.</p><p>Because of my new senses, I heard this scream louder than it should have been, and from Kaguya and Violet's stunned expressions I can tell they had the same reaction as me.</p><p>"What is it, woman!? I am watching a movie!! I still have to work later!! I want to finish this movie before I go to work!!"</p><p>"Our son lost his cherry and brought two beautiful girls home!!"</p><p>"What!? Wait a moment!! I am on my way!!"</p><p>Violet and Kaguya look at me, I try to keep my poker face as much as possible to hide my embarrassment, yes! Let's think about dolphins, dolphins are beautiful beings, and they have the intelligence of a human, umu! As expected, dolphins should be the rulers of humanity.</p><p>As I hypnotized myself, my dad started down the stairs.</p><p>When he appears in front of me, he looks at Kaguya and Violet, then he nods at me satisfied, "As expected of my son, the mason genes are running through your veins, you've got two beautiful girls! One oriental and one with a noble appearance! I was worried that you would be a virgin forever!"</p><p>He totally ignored my appearance, didn't he!? Ugh, for some reason I have a headache, although I shouldn't have a headache, since I'm a vampire and vampires have regenerative bullshit or something.</p><p>I look at my dad, he's turning 50 this year, he has brown hair and black eyes, he is 183 CM tall with a beer belly and muscular arms, he was wearing shorts and a white t-shirt.</p><p>He's a bricklayer, he works in construction, nowadays he's retired but he still goes to where he works to give advice or something, I don't really know for sure. I just know he's retired, but for some reason he says he's going to 'work', I guess old habits don't change, huh?</p><p>Cough!</p><p>I give a fake cough and go, "Violet, this is my dad Leon Walker, and this is my mom Anna Walker" I say as I introduce my parents.</p><p>"Nice to meet you," Violet says while performing in her noblewoman's mask.</p><p>"Mom and Dad, this beautiful white-haired woman is Violet, she is my wife, and this black-haired woman is her personal maid."</p><p>"...Huh...?"</p>
