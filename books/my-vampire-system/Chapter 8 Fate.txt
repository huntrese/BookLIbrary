When Vorden went to shake his hand that time, it said that Vorden had tried to use his ability on Quinn. Yet for some reason, his ability didn't work.</p><p>If Vorden's ability was ice, surely his hand would have just frozen. That's unless Quinn had an ability to block all types of abilities, but that was highly unlikely. Not only that, but straight after, even Vorden had a strange reaction, asking Quinn what his ability was; It was as if he knew his ability didn't work.</p><p>Then another thought came into Quinn's mind; why was Vorden so adamant on shaking the hands of everyone he had just met? If he remembered correctly, Erin refused to shake Vorden's hand, yet in the end, Vorden still went to touch Erin on the shoulder. At that time, it seemed like a weird thing to do, but now Quinn realized it wasn't and everything was starting to make sense.</p><p>Touching was the condition, and the last person who Vorden touched was Erin. It couldn't be a coincidence that both of them had the same powers, which meant most likely that Vorden's ability was the kind to copy other people's ability.</p><p>It didn't work on Quinn because his ability wasn't straight forward. Quinn couldn't help his curiosity, so he asked Vorden.</p><p>"Hey, Vorden is your ability..." Quinn whispered, "are you able to copy other people's abilities?"</p><p>Vorden looked at Quinn and smiled.</p><p>"I'm surprised you figured it out so fast. How did you figure it out?"</p><p>"When you shook my hand, you seemed surprised that nothing happened."</p><p>Vorden thought that Quinn was quite amazing, being able to guess something like that just from a handshake. After all, it was much more likely that Vorden had obtained the Ice ability from an ability book. The power for copying wasn't available as an ability book, which only meant one thing.</p><p>"Are you an original?" Quinn asked.</p><p>Vorden didn't say anything but simply gave a wink back at Quinn, which pretty much confirmed Quinn's thoughts.</p><p>Vorden was an Original, a person belonging to a family who decided to not share their abilities with the outside world. He is someone who could easily surpass the power level of 8.</p><p>Once the test has been completed, the hooded man teleported the students to the front of the academy where they would be staying. The academy was huge, and it's the tallest building in the entire city. It was as if someone had put together three hotels.</p><p>There were ten different teachers in total who were currently standing in front of the academy's facade. Tarrying in front of them were the groups of students who all had finished taking the test. The students were told to wait with the teachers until all the students had finished conducting their tests.</p><p>Once in a while, a group of five students would be teleported in front of one of the teachers. Finally, there was now a total of 20 students in the group where Quinn was a part of.</p><p>"Okay, you all need to follow me as I take you around the school." The teacher up front said.</p><p>The teacher was a middle-aged man with blonde curly hair who wore glasses; his name was Del.</p><p>While Del was walking around, describing the various places in the vicinity of the academy, he couldn't help but smile. It looked like nothing would be able to upset him.</p><p>"You guys should start to get to know each other as much as you can," Del said. "After all, the people you are with now will be your classmates."</p><p>All of a sudden, everyone started to get chattier, talking to each other as they were being shown around the school. However, there was something that Quinn had noticed. The mid-levels were trying their best to get friendly with the higher levels, while the low levels were completely being ignored.</p><p>Accordingly, Quinn and Peter were the only two level 1's in the class. Without realizing it, they had been pushed to the back of the group, and Peter was plodding along with his head held down. It seemed to have affected Peter a lot more than Quinn, but the latter had already suspected that this would happen.</p><p>Although suddenly, a familiar voice was heard calling out Quinn's name.</p><p>"There you are!" Vorden said. "Man, people just started jumping all over me. Then all of sudden, I look to my right side, and you're gone. Come on! Let's look around together, friend."</p><p>Quinn truly thought that Vorden was a strange person, yet that wasn't a bad thing. Vorden then noticed Peter who was on his own as well.</p><p>"Come on, stop being a downer and you come over here too."</p><p>Peter looked up and pointed a finger to himself.</p><p>"Who else do you think I'm talking to?" Vorden questioned peter.</p><p>The three of them continued to hang at the back of the class while the teacher continued to tour around the school. In the midst of the tour, a battle arena was shown to the students, where they had similar testing equipment to the ones filed on the wasteland, as well as several square fighting platforms.</p><p>They were also shown their homeroom classes, battle classes, sports rooms, and all sorts of facilities. Del never failed to provide a little bit of explanation about each area of the school where they visited, However, Quinn was uninterested in most of them until they had finally reached the library.</p><p>"As you can all see, the library here is split into three floors. First-year students are only able to access the first floor; meanwhile, the second-year students can access the second floor; finally, the last floor is only for Military personnel."</p><p>Quinn was interested in the library because it contained books that weren't available to the public. In this place, Quinn just might be able to find some information about his ability, though he just hoped that it would be on the first floor.</p><p>Eventually, the tour came to an end as Del stopped just outside the school's dorms.</p><p>"And this is where you will be living during your stay here. Once you have dropped off your things, feel free to explore around the academy. There will be no lessons today, so you will get to have the rest of the afternoon to explore."</p><p>Each student was then handed a number written on a piece of paper. These papers displayed which room they would be staying in.</p><p>Quinn then noticed from the corner of his eye that Vorden was coming towards him.</p><p>"Hey, Quinn what room number did you get?" Vorden asked.</p><p>"Err 23."</p><p>"No way! You're kidding, right? I got the same number. Maybe fate is really bringing us together." Vorden said excitedly.</p><p>"Maybe" Quinn replied.</p><p>On the other hand, somewhere down the hallway, two other students were having a conversation.</p><p>"Woah! What happened to you?" A student said as he looked at his friend.</p><p>"I don't know man, some guy just appeared and hit me out of nowhere, forcing me to swap room numbers."</p><p>"Man, should we try to get it back?" The student asked.</p><p>"Nah if I saw his wrist correctly, it said he was a level 5. It's best if we just leave it"</p>
