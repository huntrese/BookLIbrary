He smiled and said, "Let's go, we are getting late too". Then he mumbled, "why do I feel that man looked quite familiar?" He shook his head and moved forward.</p><p>As they entered into the flight, they saw both men with whom they collided before were sitting inside. YuYan gave them displeased look and moved her site in opposite direction. after checking the seat numbers, Jiang siblings sat in their seats which were in front of these two men. Plane finally took off and after some time it was flying in the air. Air hostess done with the safety instructions and served refreshments to passengers. Four of them were relaxed as they were able to catch this flight on time.</p><p>At the last moment, the flight these four were about to board got canceled due to some technical issues. So they had to book the next flight but business class seats were not available so they had to travel by economy class. </p><p>"YuYan, finally we are in plane. I thought we will definately miss it." Jiang Yang said and gave a sigh of relief.</p><p>Jiang YuYan was still upset and said ,"it would have been better that way. Why didn't we miss it??" Then she looked at her brother, "you know that I don't want to go back to China and also don't want to study there but you are on their side. I hate you brother" she said pouting her lips with sadness in her eyes.</p><p>"YuYan, it's not like that. You are thinking in a wrong way. You know very well our parents always did everything for our well being. This time mom is very firm on her decision and nobody can change it." </p><p>"I think study is just an excuse. They are taking me there because they must have found someone for me to get married. Otherswise what's with this sudden change in their attitude??" Jiang YuYan said still carrying sad and irritated expressions on her face.</p><p>"They will never do anything against your will, let alone marriage." Jiang Yang said with concern in his eyes.</p><p>Both were unaware that the men sitting behind were able to hear them.</p><p>"Boss why didn't you say anything to them? It was not our fault and how can she talk to you like that? You shouldn't have stopped me. "Asst Xio Min Said with unsatisfied expressions on his face.</p><p>"She is not someone you can deal like this", said the man, then closed his eyes and leaned back to take a rest with his lips slightly curved upward.</p><p>Assistant Xio Min was confused with what his boss said but before he could ask anything the man went to sleep. Though his eyes were closed his full attention was on these siblings' conversation.</p><p>Jiang YuYan : " they will definately hook me with someone.</p><p>Jiang Yang : "They will not find someone ordinary for you. That person is definately gonna be from a third generation rich family heir or CEO of one company." He said with little mischievous smile on his face. He was enjoying her annoyed reaction."</p><p>"I don't want to marry any rich family's heir or CEO types", she said with little angry tone.</p><p>"Huuuu!!!!, What.....What is there not to like them? Every single girl out there dreams for such person." He was quite surprised with her words.</p><p>"Brother Yang I am not like those girls who runs after money. I read lots of novels and also heard from my Freinds that these rich heirs or CEOs are kind of scary people. They always carry cold aura around them with no facial expressions like they have facial paralysis. They are scary, rude, ignorant, inconsiderate, stubborn, have no feelings, treats women like....ummm like..."she was struggling for a word and looking here and there to get it.</p><p>Jiang yang pointed to the water bottle in front of him and asked, "water bottle??" </p><p>Jiang YuYan,"No brother!!" </p><p>Then he pointed to the coffee mug in front of him and asked, "coffee??" coffee mug??</p><p>Jiang YuYan: "Brother Yang!!!! That's not it"</p><p>Then he pointed to last thing left on the small tray in front of him and asked, "tissue paper??"</p><p>Jiang YuYan: "yes that's it!! Tissue paper!!" Now her face was again carrying the same expressions, which were on her face before she stopped struggling for word.</p><p>"They treats women like tissue paper, use them as they please and then throw them away." She said it with face full of rage as she was the leader of all the women suffered because of the rich men.</p><p>Jiang Yang: "you could have used water bottle or coffee mug too, as they are also meant to use and throw." He said to annoy her but she ignored and continued.</p><p>"You know brother?? with there cold gaze they can give heart attack to weak hearted person, always busy in work no time for family, look down on others...hmmmm...", Jiang YuYan said everything in single breath without stopping. Even Jiang Yang was worried and was about to ask her to take a breath just then she stopped. Her face was kind of red, she took a long deep breath and continued.</p><p>"And there is more they are.....", Suddenly Jiang Yang stopped her and said, "stop stop, I understood everything". She stopped with puzzled look on her face and Jiang Yang gave a sigh of relief not in mood to listen his sister's long list of complaining qualities of one of his would be brother in law.</p><p>At the same time a man behind them who was listening everything with his eyes closed and mumbled, "she is still the same" with big smile on his face. His assistant was amazed to see this eye catching view of his face which was rare to see but he didn't dare to ask anything to him.</p><p>Then, what kind of a person you want to marry my dear little sister??", Jiang Yang asked curiously.</p><p></p>
