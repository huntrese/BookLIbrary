Jiang Yang was dumbfounded on her sister's reply, with his eyes wide open he was unable to say anything. He expected her to get angry but....!! He stoped her and finally said, "little sis I lost, you won."</p><p>A man sitting behind was still listening these siblings' conversation with his eyes closed and was smiling, showing his cute canines.</p><p>"Brother Yang , I am only 18 and just learning to fly but these people wants to cut my wings before I could take off. I still have lot more things to do in life. I want to fullfill my dreams and wants to be an independent woman first", Jiang YuYan said with a determination to do something in the life.

Just bear it for few years and about your actual dream, no one is going to stop you. This marriage thing doesn't make any sense". He said while consoling her.</p><p>The handsome man behind them was now curious to know about her dream but Jiang yang suddenly said, "now close your eyes and take some rest. It was already a tiresome day for us." She nodded, leaned back and closed her eyes. The handsome man was quite disappointed. After having dinner everyone went to sleep.</p><p>Next day morning everyone got out of the airport and headed towards there own way. Jiang YuYan's sight crossed across the handsome man but she frowned and ignored him, while Jiang Yang nodded with a small smile to the man like compensating for his sister's rude behaviour. Handsome man smiled and nodded too.</p><p>At the outside of airport a black Maybach was waiting. Handsome man reached to the car. A car driver bowed and said," good morning young master Lu". Then he opened the car door for him. He sat on back passenger sit and his assistant sat in front passenger seat of the car. </p><p>As the car moved in its way, the man leaned back and was staring outside of the car window. He suddenly remembered the girl's startled face and smiled.</p><p>Then he mumbled to himself, "will see you soon YuYan!!!" There was a sparkle in his eyes as he was excited about something.</p><p>At the same time, the another car was waiting for Jiang Yang and Jiang YuYan. The driver got out and greeted them. Both sat inside the car and headed towards their destination. It was Jiang Peizhi's car and driver. They recognised him as everytime they came to China, this same person received them from airport.</p><p>After sitting inside the car Jiang Yang looked at his sister and asked,"still upset??? Cheer up!!"</p><p>Jiang YuYan: "No!! I am not." </p><p>"Then, why are you still having a long face?"</p><p>"I thought about it whole night. I know that I am wrong about our parents. I just said all those things in a feet of an anger." She said while thinking about something.</p><p>"I love them and will do anything they asked me to. And you are right that marriage thing doesn't make any sense as we know them very well. It's just that, she was supporting my dream until yesterday and now suddenly asked me to do something that I don't want to, even without giving me a proper explanation."</p><p>Jiang Yang : " Yes! you are right but mom always think ahead of the things that we don't know about. Just trust her!!"</p><p>Jiang YuYan : "I know and I trust her a lot brother Yang"</p><p>Jiang YuYan : "That's like my sweet sister." and both smiled looking at each other.</p><p>______ ________ ____________</p><p>At old Lu mansion..</p><p>The black car arrived at the gate.
