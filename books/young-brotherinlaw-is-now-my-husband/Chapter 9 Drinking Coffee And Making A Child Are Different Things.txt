She was wearing a simple gold chain around her neck, small gold tops on her ears and a her wedding ring on her finger. She was a beautiful and elegant lady, always liked to keep her attire very simple but still it looked very classy on her.</p><p>The Handsome man saw her, walked in her direction with a smile and hugged her.</p><p>After a hug she asked, "Lu Qiang!!! How have you been?? It's been a week since I last saw you. I really missed you." Her eyes were filled with happiness and her face was having smile stretching from ear to ear.</p><p>"I missed you too grandma!!", Lu Qiang said with the same feeling of happiness as her. </p><p>Asst Xio Min bowed to her and said, "Good morning, Madam Lu."</p><p>"Good morning, Xio Min"</p><p>Then Lu Qiang looked at him and said, "Asst Xio Min you can head back to your home and take a rest." Asst Xio Min then bowed to both of them and took his leave.</p><p>____ _____ ______</p><p>Lu Qiang, the elder son of Lu Jinhai and the heir of Lu corporation.</p><p>After Lu Jinhai's accident Lu corporation was in a mess as it was a huge blow for the family and the company. At that moment, Lu Qiang took charge of everything. </p><p>There were so many people in the company who opposed and created problems for him, but just like his father he too was not an easy person to deal with, though he was just 18 yrs old. </p><p>Since he was young, he was following his father's work, though his dream was to became a soccer player and was not much interested in business. Lu Jinhai already started to nurture him to prepare for the future, incase there is any kind of emergency.</p><p>He was an obedient and a filial son. He learnt about business as well as the people he might have to deal with in future.</p><p>He was very handsome and talented young man, obviously it was because of the perfect genes from his parents. He was very loving, caring and protective towards his family but at the same time cold towards the outsiders. Anyone could see the difference in his behaviour with his family and others. </p><p>He was a man of few words. In company everyone feared him more than chairman Lu Jinhai, as he had to take some strict actions to deal with trouble makers when he took charge the Lu corporation in his hands. Everyone called him a devil in a disguise of an angel.</p><p>______ _______ _________</p><p>"Grandma where is the old man?" Lu Qiang asked with the smirk in his eyes. </p><p>Before grandma could answer, a loud and angry voice came from the door behind Lu Qiang, " you rascal!! who are you calling an old man?? I am still very much younger to give you few more uncles and aunts, ask your grandma. </p><p>Lu Shuang : "__" ( when he will stop being shameless?)</p><p>Lu Qiang : "__" ( as expected of my grandfather).</p><p>Butler : "__" (cough**cough!!)</p><p>Elder Lu Huan just came back from his morning stroll. He was wearing white t-shirt and a grey track pant, in which he looked younger than his actual age. When he reached to the door, he saw Lu Qiang and his wife were greeting each other and Lu Qiang calling him an old man. His expressions changed while thinking, "How dare he call me an old man in front of my woman?"</p><p>When Lu Qiang saw him, he walked towards elder Lu Huan. "Grandpa!! How are you?", he asked with a smile on his face and hugged him. Elder Lu hugged him back. </p><p>Everyone in the house heard elder Lu's loud voice. They came out of their rooms as it was also going to be a time for breakfast. </p><p>Lu Jinhai came downstairs with his wife Lu Jiahui and asked," who made my father spilled out his golden words early in the morning??" He then smiled, walked towards his son and hugged him. Both were about to talk after a hug, suddenly a they heard a voice from their side.</p><p> "Do you want my golden words to become true??" asking this elder Lu Huan looked at his son Lu Jinhai then walked toward his wife.</p><p>Lu Jinhai smiled and said, "I don't have any problem with that only if mother is ready." Then he looked at his mother.</p><p>Lu Shuang poked her elbow in elder Lu's stomach and said, "Are you planning to betray me and bring a mistress in this house?"</p><p>Her words startled elder Lu Huan. "W...what are you saying?? When I said that??"</p><p>"Then what was the meaning of the words you said before?? As you know right now I am not in a condition to help you make your golden words come true??"</p><p>Lu Huan panicked and said, "No darling, I can't even think about it. You are the only one for me." He said with innocent puppy like expressions on his face then he looked at his son and gave him a frightening gaze as calling him 'Rascal' in his mind.</p><p>Lu Jinhai smiled mischievously while looking at his father as replying to his gaze 'like father, like son'.</p><p>Everyone one was used to see this 180 degree turn in elder Lu's behavior when it comes to his wife, so everyone just smiled. </p><p>Lu Jiahui hugged her son and said,"you must be tired. Go, get fresh and come downstairs for breakfast." As he nodded and was about to leave after greeting his uncle and aunt, her sight crossed across the stains on his white shirt. she asked, "wait!!! What happened to your shirt? It looks like you spilled coffee on your shirt." </p><p>He lowered his face to look at the stains on his shirt, replied with, "mmm..." with a quite invisible smile on his lips.</p><p>Lu Huan: "Can't even drink a coffee properly and I was expecting to have the great grandchildren from him." </p><p>Lu jinhai: "Drinking coffee and making a child are both different things", and looked at his father</p><p>Lu Huan : "No it's not different!! I am afraid, he might have a habbit to spill everything out like a coffee."</p><p>Lu Qiang : "...."!! Cough**cough</p><p></p>
