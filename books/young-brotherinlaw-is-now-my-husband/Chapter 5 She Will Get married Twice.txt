Are they coming or not?</p><p>Lu Jinhai looked at her wife and gave small smile as if saying thanx for breaking the ice and said," yes dear he is coming and this time his whole family will be here. He was very happy to hear about event. He is eager to meet everyone. He is already here in China with his wife. He was busy with some work so couldn't come to visit us but he will be attending the anniversary celebration for sure", he said with happiness on his face. Afterall he was going to meet his best freind after a long time. Now the atmosphere in the room started to become normal</p><p>Lu Chen: "Brother, how are their kids. It's been 8 years since I saw them. Both of them must be well grown up now. Both were too adorable."</p><p>Lu Jinhai: You are right Lu Chen. Both of them took after their parents. Well behaved and talented. This time they are coming too. Jiang Peizhi said that Jiang YuYan and Jiang yang are going stay in China from now on. </p><p>When elder Lu Huan heard about Jiang Peizhi his anger subsidised and he started to give attention to the discussion about Jiang Family. When they mentioned about Jiang Peizhi's kids he said," I missed Jiang YuYan. It's been a while I saw that child. She must have became wonderful lady like her mother.". Then he started to recall the memories of the past when all these kids used to play together at Lu mansion. Those were few of the blissful moments in his life. He now had a smile on his face. He liked Jiang YuYan alot. </p><p>When everyone saw this change in a mood of elder Lu Huan, they felt relaxed.

After coming to china both husband and wife were busy with interior decoration of their new home. When done with the instructions, she came to living room and sat besides Jiang Peizhi.</p><p>Jiang Ruolan : " The Day after tomorrow, kids are going to came back to china I hope I'll be able to finish all the arrangements before their arrival. I want them to be comfortable in this house."</p><p>Jiang Peizhi : " Don't worry everything will be done soon. " He then put his news paper aside and looked at Jiang Ruolan and then asked, " why did you insist on calling Jiang YuYan and Jiang Yang back to china suddenly?? Why did you want them to study here in China??</p><p>Jiang Ruolan was quite startled with these sudden attack of questions out of the blue from Jiang Peizhi. She then replied with calm expressions, " it's nothing!!! I just feel that now it's time for them to come back to their home country. I don't want them to spend their lives on foreign land. It will be good for them to get familiar with everything here and adjust themselves according. Anyhow Jiang yang is coming back to china forever and I don't want Jiang YuYan to stay there alone."</p><p>Jiang Peizhi then smiled and hold his wife's hand and said, "Ruolan!!! I want to know the real reason. It's been 25 years since we are married. I know you very well. You never did anything without a big reason. Whatever it may be just tell me."</p><p>Jiang Ruolan: " Well!!! Two years back when I came to china for my friend's daughter's wedding, I went to the temple with one of my freind. She was going to meet there master Si Xia to show her son's birth card so I too did the same and showed him our kids birth cards. Everything about Jiang Yang was ok butt...!! </p><p>There was a long pause after her last sentences so Jiang Peizhi asked her," is there something about Jiang YuYan??"</p><p>Jiang Ruolan Nodded and said, " I know you don't believe in these things and neither do I but you know how the heart of mother works" </p><p>"I know and I'll try to understand your reasoning..so tell me now."</p><p>"When I showed master Si Xia Jiang YuYan's birth card, he said that her life is complicated. When she will turn 20, her life is going to take a huge turn. It will affect her greatly, that it can either make her or break her. Her life will depend solely on her decisions. Her happiness and sadness both are in her own hands and nobody can meddle in that or help her. Her stars shows that she will be powerfull and renowned person in business world. And...." She said with worried expressions on her face.</p><p>"And...what??"</p><p>Master said, "she is a moon and there are two suns around her."</p><p>Jiang Peizhi: "__"????</p><p>Jiang Ruolan: "She might get married twice."She said with the same worried expressions.</p><p></p>
