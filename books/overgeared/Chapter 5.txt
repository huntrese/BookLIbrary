<p></p><p>  				Chapter 5</p><p>It was a completely unwelcome quest. Was it because I didn’t like the rewards? That was impossible! </p><p>‘This reward is really good…’ </p><p>3,000 gold was worth around 3,600,000 won when converted into real cash, which was close to 40 days of revenue for me if I worked without any rest.  But the great thing was the title of ‘Earl’s Son-in-Law’. </p><p>All stats +20!  I currently had nine stats in total: strength, stamina, agility, intelligence, dexterity, composure, indomitable, dignity and insight. If I added the nobility stat, that would equal 10 in total. </p><p>If all of these stats were given 20 points, it would be a total of 200 stat points. Every time I gained a level, 10 stat points were obtained, so 200 stat points were worth 20 levels. It would also be wonderful to have a beautiful aristocratic lady as my bride. </p><p>‘The road is open. But…’ </p><p>There was a reason why the rewards were so good. It was an S grade quest! </p><p>‘Earl Ashur’s Fury was an S grade quest. ’</p><p>At the time of the quest, I was level 79 but couldn’t cope with the difficulty. I was killed many times during the quest and dropped down to level 73. In addition, the time spent was three months! </p><p>I was currently level -1, so I had no means of clearly an S grade quest with a time limit. Why would I accept a quest that would obviously fail? </p><p>‘Furthermore, my level will fall by two if I fail.’ </p><p>My body trembled with fear and anger at the thought of my level dropping to -3. </p><p>‘But why on earth is it an S grade quest again?’ </p><p>S grade quests were never common quests. Even the top level rankers who were above level 200 could only count the number of times that they’ve received an S grade quest on their left hands.  However, I wasn’t high level user and was currently at level -1. </p><p>I recalled what Doran said: </p><p>‘As you know, the Yatan Temple is filled with evil energy. Ordinary people will become afraid if they stay here for a while. But I observed you, and you are fine despite all the time that passed. In addition, you can even manage to laugh alone. You, don’t you actually have great abilities?’</p><p>There were hints in these words.  The quest seemed to be generated by staying in the Yatan Temple for a certain period of time without falling into the ‘fear’ state. My title and composure stat lowered my chances of falling under an abnormal condition. </p><p>Was it good? Did I like it? </p><p>‘Won’t I be screwed if this is a forced quest? The attributes of this title are crazy, but it’s like this game is trying to make me quit.’ </p><p>I replied unhesitatingly,</p><p>“I can’t do it. Ask someone else.” </p><p></p><p>[The quest was refused.] </p><p></p><p>I refused the quest, but Doran didn’t quit. </p><p>“You are the only unusual person, so please help me. A precious person’s life is involved!” </p><p></p><p>[Doran is desperate. Do you understand his sad circumstances and accept the quest?] </p><p></p><p>The concept of the notification window was lost. Did it think I was in a position to take care of others right now?  I immediately swiped the window away and said, “You are mistaken. I am weak and incompetent, so I won’t be able to help you. It would be better for you to take care of it alone.” </p><p></p><p>[The quest was refused.] </p><p></p><p>“As you know, the believers of Yatan use powerful black magic! I can’t rescue the young lady from them alone! Please don’t turn away, lend me your strength!” </p><p></p><p>[Doran hasn’t given up. Would you like to accept the quest?) </p><p></p><p>“No, first of all, I don’t have the ability to do it…” </p><p></p><p>[The quest was refused.] </p><p></p><p>“You are too modest! Don’t you know that the power to ignore their fear isn’t common?” </p><p></p><p>[Doran can only depend on you. Would you like to accept the quest?] </p><p></p><p>Sometimes, there were quest NPCs who would persist like this. They had their own desperate situations. Yes, I could understand Doran’s feelings. If Doran returned without rescuing his master’s daughter, his head would go flying off. </p><p>But what about me? What if I failed and my level dropped again? </p><p>Why should I go through such terrible things because of him? I was more important than a complete stranger! The biggest problem was that I didn’t have the ability to help him in the first place. </p><p>“Please help! I am begging you!” </p><p>Doran fell to his knees. </p><p>I looked at him.  This man, all the words I spoke to him were entering one ear and leaving the other. Or maybe he thought I was lying. </p><p>‘It’s probably the latter. Is it so great that I don’t feel fear while staying in the Yatan Temple? I haven’t been here before so I don’t even know what I’m supposed to feel.’ </p><p>I faced Doran head on and explained with a more serious attitude,</p><p>“I’m really sorry, but I truly don’t have the strength to help you. Don’t waste your time on me; call the earl and ask for his help.” </p><p></p><p>[The quest was refused.] </p><p></p><p>“Every hour is urgent! The young lady’s life might be in danger while I go to ask the earl for help! You are the only person I can rely on! This is a request!” </p><p></p><p>[Doran is hoping for a helping hand. Would you like to accept the quest?] </p><p></p><p>The limits of patience. </p><p>“Ah, this is frustrating! Do you really need my help? I don’t want to look at you anymore, so go away!” </p><p>“Please give mercy for the sake of her life!” </p><p>“What? No! Damn. Yes, I should leave. I am going now!” </p><p>I once again refused the quest and turned away from Doran. This was a terrible quest that would cause my level to drop by two upon failure, so I wanted to avoid it. But unlike my thoughts, my feet didn’t move quickly. I was 200% over the weight limit, so my movement speed was reduced by 100%. </p><p>Doran saw that I was moving as slow as a turtle and misunderstood my actions as he teared up. </p><p>“You act so intimidatingly, but you are actually conflicted… You really do want to help me…” </p><p>“……” </p><p>“Stop feeling conflicted and help me!” </p><p></p><p>[Doran feels hope again. Would you like to accept the quest?] </p><p></p><p>“Bullshit! I won’t help!” </p><p></p><p>[The quest was refused.] </p><p></p><p>I ignored him and hastened my steps. But once again, my speed was slow. This only deepened Doran’s misunderstanding. </p><p>“Maybe you’re conflicted because your life is busy, but the life of a person is more important! This is a request!!” </p><p>“I can’t! It isn’t possible!” </p><p>“Don’t deceive yourself! In fact, you are suffering as well! You can’t leave this place immediately, which is why there is such hesitation in your step!” </p><p>“There is no hesitation! I’m not walking slowly! My baggage is heavy, that’s all!” </p><p>Doran continued chasing after me, and my slow pace couldn’t get rid of him. </p><p></p><p>[Would you like to accept the quest?] </p><p>[Would you like to accept the quest?] </p><p>[Would you like…] </p><p></p><p>‘What a stupid jerk!’ </p><p>The notification windows kept popping up no matter how much I refused. I had to make a drastic decision. </p><p>‘I can’t carry on like this. Yes, I have to refuse, even if I develop a hostile relationship with him. He isn’t a NPC I need to build up a relationship with, so it won’t hurt if he is my enemy.’ </p><p>I pulled out Mamon’s greatsword and glared at Doran. </p><p>“I definitely can’t help you. If you don’t get away right now, I am prepared to hurt you.” </p><p>Doran grasped the atmosphere and took one step back. Then he slowly opened his mouth. </p><p>“I really wish you would help me…” </p><p></p><p>[Doran is asking for the last time. Would you like to accept the quest?] </p><p></p><p>Swipe! </p><p>How many times do I have to see this damn notification window? </p><p>“I won’t help! Even if I can help, I don’t want to! I won’t help!” </p><p>My stress went over the threshold and I could no longer suppress my anger. In the end, I yelled and swung Mamon’s greatsword, expressing my intent not to talk to Doran anymore. </p><p>Then… </p><p>Kwajak! </p><p>“Kaaack!” </p><p>The sensation of hitting something was transmitted through my fingertips as a scream was heard at the same time. I turned my gaze to the side of the greatsword and saw what just occurred: a believer wearing the robe of Yatan had collapsed with Mamon’s greatsword in his neck. An ominous chill went down my spine. </p><p>“I was aiming at the crazy guy, so why did the person next to him…” </p><p>As I stared at the dying believer, a new notification window popped up. </p><p></p><p>[Your relationship with the Yatan Church has become hostile.] </p><p>[You won’t be able to receive Yatan’s blessings.] </p><p>[The followers of Yatan will try to kill you when they find you.] </p><p></p><p>The atmosphere of the temple changed. While I was surrounded by dozens of Yatan believers, Doran got up and placed a hand on my shoulder and cried out, “Thank you!!” </p><p>“Eh?” </p><p></p><p>[Rescue the Earl’s Esteemed Daughter] </p><p>Difficulty: S </p><p>Irene, the only daughter of Earl Steim, is a beautiful and innocent virgin. The elders of Yatan had kidnapped Irene in order to sacrifice her for her virgin blood. </p><p>You can’t tolerate the evil deeds of Yatan’s followers. You must surely rescue Irene.</p><p>Quest Clear Conditions: Rescue Irene within one hour after accepting the quest. </p><p>Clear Reward: 3,000 gold, a low probability of becoming the earl’s son-in-law. </p><p>* Earl’s son-in-law: Nobility stat will open, all stats +20. </p><p>You will be treated as a viscount after marrying the earl’s esteemed daughter. Power and honor will rise. You can advance into the social circle of the nobles. You will receive a monthly salary. This can be a shortcut to becoming a high-ranking official or lord. </p><p>Quest Failure: Level -2. </p><p></p><p>[The quest has been accepted.] </p><p></p><p>“Wow.” </p><p>Due to my hostile relationship with the Yatan Church, the ‘Rescue the Earl’s Esteemed Daughter’ quest was forced upon me. </p><p>“Huhuhu…” </p><p>Some might say this was unlucky. No, it was more accurate to say that I had no luck. </p><p>‘Failure once again… it will be level -3!’ </p><p>At any rate, I had no luck. Perhaps I sold a country in my previous life.</p><p>“Who dares hurt Yatan’s believers! Aren’t you afraid of the curse of God Yatan?”</p><p>“God Yatan is almighty! God Yatan has already noticed your sin! You won’t be safe for the rest of your life!”</p><p>“You will pay a heavy price for your blasphemy!”</p><p>The angry voices of the Yatan followers clamored around me. Their crazy eyes were filled with absolute hostility.</p><p>‘Will I die now?’</p><p>The followers of Yatan were black magicians. Black magicians had strong curse abilities, so they were difficult to deal with.  				</p>
