<p></p><p>  				Chapter 21</p><p>After breakfast, my parents immediately headed towards the vegetable store that they ran. The two of them normally left at 5 a.m, so they were quite late today.</p><p>‘They are late because of breakfast with their son.’</p><p>I suddenly felt that tsunami of emotions again as tears filled my eyes. It was the first time my stomach felt so full in a while. </p><p>I sat on the couch and dozed off, before waking up because of Sehee. Sehee had changed into her school uniform and looked like a neat schoolgirl. She was my sister, but I had to admit that she was beautiful.</p><p>“What? Why are you looking at me like that?”</p><p>“I’m glad to see you. You grew up well.”</p><p>“W-What are you saying all of a sudden!?” Sehee flushed red before hitting my forearm.</p><p>‘What? Did I do something wrong? But what is this cool feeling?’</p><p>I felt some relief in the area that Sehee had hit. It was like a massage!</p><p>“Ahh, good! Hit me more! More! Keep hitting.”</p><p>“Kyaaak! Pervert!”</p><p>Slap!</p><p>…Why did she slap me all of a sudden? I placed a hand on my tingling cheek as Sehee shouted, “I’ve filled up the tub with hot water. Then your body will feel better. This perverted Oppa!”</p><p>“Ah, eh, yes…”</p><p>She was someone who got angry at me but always took care of me.</p><p>‘But why am I a pervert?’</p><p>Sehee headed to school while I soaked in the hot water.</p><p>“My fatigue is going away.”</p><p>Then after a few moments…</p><p>I exited the bathroom and paid the loan interest through a direct account transfer. It was hard to bear seeing the money from my blood and sweat disappear before my eyes.</p><p>“Ugh… This world is hell…”</p><p>I needed stability. So, I hurriedly entered the capsule and connected to Satisfy.</p><p>‘How much have the arrows sold for?’</p><p>“Login.”</p><p>Jiing.</p><p>The capsule’s door closed, and my field of view slowly turned black. Then the familiar system voice and music entered my eyes, then my vision brightened again.</p><p>“The air is good.”</p><p>I appeared in a place which reminded me of a charming village in medieval Europe and immediately stated a command, “Status window.”</p><p></p><p>Name: Grid </p><p>Level: 3 (75/500)</p><p>Class: Pagma’s Descendant</p><p>* The probability of adding additional options when making items will increase.</p><p>* The probably of item enhancement will increase. </p><p>* All equipment items can be worn unconditionally. </p><p> However, there is a penalty depending on the rating of the item. </p><p>Title: One who Became a Legend</p><p>* Abnormal conditions don’t work well for you.</p><p>* You won’t die when health is at the minimum.</p><p>* Easily acknowledged.</p><p>Health: 336/336    Mana: 87/87</p><p>Strength: 24 + 5   Stamina: 22   Agility: 16  Intelligence: 29 </p><p>Dexterity: 55  Persistence: 21</p><p>Composure: 14  Indomitable: 16   Dignity: 14   Insight: 14</p><p>Stat Points: 60</p><p>Weight: 3,095/1,000</p><p>* The weight limit exceeds 200%, so movement speed is reduced by 100%. </p><p>The body is heavy and cannot exert any power properly. </p><p>The probability of receiving the ‘weakened’ state has become really high.</p><p></p><p>“Level 3… Huhu, is that really the case?” </p><p>My stats had increased by making an epic rated item. Considering the 60 stat points which I hadn’t used yet, I was actually around level 26. If I equipped Mamon’s Greatsword and Mengel’s Plate Armor, I could demonstrate the combat power of a level 50.</p><p>“Is this the feeling of superiority that only a special person can feel? Huhuhut…”</p><p>In a square filled with people, I forgot the harshness of reality as I talked excitedly to myself. Then with one hand on my hip, I laughed like the protagonist of a movie. The women passing by sent me dirty looks and gossiped with each other.</p><p>“What is with that person? Striking such a strange pose and laughing while talking to himself.”</p><p>“Is he on an ego trip? Perhaps he has the prince disease?”</p><p>“He is ugly. He probably doesn’t have a lover.”</p><p>Normally, I would be unhappy, but right now, I was so thrilled that I didn’t care about the gazes of others. I ignored what they were saying and checked the experience of my various skills.</p><p></p><p>[Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill] Lv 1 (3.7%)</p><p>[Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath] Lv 1 (2.0%) </p><p></p><p>I’d thought it would take longer for the experience of these skills to rise. </p><p>‘Is it thanks to making an epic item?’</p><p>I headed to the auction house with a light heart. As usual, the auction house was bustling with people.</p><p>“I wonder what the winning bid is…”</p><p>The price for one Jaffa Arrow was six silver. However, the Jaffa Arrows I’d made had an epic rating! I expected the price to be 3~4 times higher. </p><p>In the case of general equipment items, it was reasonable to calculate that rare-rated items would be three times more expensive than normal items, while epic items would be seven times more expensive than normal items.</p><p>However, I soon became worried. Would even a rich user want to spend so much money buying arrows? In the first place, consumables were cheap compared to equipment items.</p><p>‘Yes, don’t expect too much.’</p><p>I opened the auction window while thinking that I would be satisfied if they sold for double the price. Then…</p><p>“K-Keok…!”</p><p>After confirming the bidding price of the Jaffa Arrows, I couldn’t shut my mouth. Meanwhile, I could hear the voices of the women looking at me.</p><p>“Isn’t he that person laughing to himself in the square? Oh. my. What is he doing now? His mouth has fallen open.”</p><p>“Kyaaak~! His saliva is dripping! Nasty!”</p><p>“Ugly… He must have no lover.”</p><p>“Argh… Uhhh…”</p><p>I tried to shut my mouth, but it wasn’t easy.</p><p></p><p>[Special Jaffa Arrow] (99 Pieces)</p><p>[Bid Price: 72 silver per piece.] </p><p></p><p>It sold for 12 times the price of ordinary Jaffa Arrows!</p><p>“Eh…uh…aack…”</p><p>I touched the inventory with trembling hands, then I took out the calculator which was a default item provided to all users. 99×72=?</p><p>“…7,128…”</p><p>100 silver was 1 gold. 7,128 silver meant 71 gold and 28 silver. For reference, 100 gold was worth around 120,000 won in cash.</p><p>‘Didn’t I create 100 arrows in around a day?’</p><p>It was approximately a day in game time. If I calculated it in real time, I’d earned around 84,000 won in less than six hours.</p><p>“Ha…hahaha…”</p><p>I was thrilled. Uncontrollable laughter emerged from my mouth, “Puhahahahat!”</p><p>“T-That person has finally gone mad!”</p><p>“Ugly! He definitely doesn’t have a lover! His mother must be the only female contact in his phone.”</p><p>‘Cough, do their words have to be so sharp?’</p><p>No, I wouldn’t be shaken by these females.</p><p>‘Talk in your hearts.’ </p><p>At this moment, I could still smile even while hearing such shameful words.</p><p>‘I can see a definite way.’</p><p>Debt?</p><p>“I will pay it back in the game!”</p><p>There was no need to go find labor jobs. It was more profitable to make money from the items I create in the game. Indeed, Pagma’s Descendant was definitely a goose that lay golden eggs.</p><p>I formed a fist and shivered, while the auctioneer at the counter handed me gold and silver coins. However, why was the amount of money lacking?</p><p>“Why are you only giving me 60 gold and 59 silver?”</p><p>The auction house manager smiled at my question.</p><p>“The amount is limited to 10 gold and 69 silver because of the sales commission. There is a 15% sales commission for epic rated items. Thank you for using our service.”</p><p>The commission fee was 8% for normal rated items and 10% for rare rated items. Compared to that, the sales commission for epic rated items was too expensive.</p><p>‘How much is the commission fee for unique or legendary rated items?’ </p><p>Suddenly, the auction house and Mother’s Heart is Happy seemed to overlap. Exploitation was the same in reality and in Satisfy.</p><p>“Shit… I will become a successful person who exploits the weak…”</p><p>I would produce legendary items which weren’t possible for anyone else except Pagma’s Descendant! The two billion users in Satisfy would be overwhelmed!</p><p>“But that is a story for the distant future. Ugh!”</p><p>Tears flowed as I thought about the 15% commission. This was because the day before, I hadn’t been able to open a stall because I’d needed to go work, so I had decided to use the auction house. </p><p>Once I got the money, I thought about whether I should take the carriage to Winston Village or not.</p><p>‘I can stay here and make a lot of money with the Jaffa Arrows, so do I really need to move villages?’</p><p>I was trying to move villages because I wanted to find a suitable hunting ground. However, I didn’t need to cling to hunting and leveling up, when I could make a profit by making items.</p><p>‘It would be good to just stay here and make items all the time…’</p><p>However, there was one thing I had to consider. It was the fact that Smith was gay!</p><p>‘If I stay here alone with him… Just imagining it was terrible.’</p><p>I wasn’t in a hurry to hunt now, but I would be more comfortable living in a village suitable for my level. In the end, I decided to move to Winston as planned and headed towards the carriages. Just like last time, I started negotiating the price while armed with the saddest stories.</p><p>“My ailing sister is waiting for me in Winston Village…”</p><p>“Oh, no! Then I will leave one hour early. Climb into my carriage!” </p><p>“But right now, I only have seven gold…”</p><p>“Oh, I thought you were a customer with a reservation. I’m sorry.”</p><p>My first bargaining attempt failed!</p><p>“My grandmother died the day before I was born, and her death anniversary is today. I needed to go to Winston Village right now, but I only have 7 gold and 50 silver…”</p><p>“Um, I want to help you because of your high reputation and your situation, but it is too much of a loss to visit Winston VIllage for 7 gold and 50 silver. I’m sorry.”</p><p>My second bargaining attempt failed. It was the same as humans constantly stepping on other humans. </p><p>“You should give me a choco pie, ah, these people. You should realize that we are all the same!”</p><p>In the end, I failed to negotiate the price I wanted, but I got on the carriage that was the cheapest.</p><p>“Let’s depart for Winston. It should be a quick and safe trip, considering the money I paid. And be friendly! You should show full hospitality.”</p><p>“…I will be very grateful if you didn’t talk.”</p><p>Travelling always made people excited. The bumpy carriage ride and the unfriendly attitude of the coachman were bad, but my mood was good.  				</p>
