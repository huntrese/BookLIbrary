<p></p><p></p><p>"I do not know which hole you crawled from, but consider this is your last warning!" Ren Fuchen said as he unsheathed the sword by his side, causing the aura around him to change.</p><p>Yuan looked at Ren Fuchen with a smile. Instead of worrying that he might have to fight another human for the first time, he actually found this situation to be pretty entertaining.</p><p align="center" class="adsbox" id="lightnovelpub_Billboard_Inlist_1"></p><p>"You wanna fight? Let's go! I have been wanting to test my sword on something that's not monster for once!" Yuan also retrieved his sword.</p><p>When Ren Fuchen saw Yuan's sword that was emitting a powerful and sharp aura, his eyes widened with shock.</p><p>"A Spirit-grade sword… and it's even peak quality! He actually has a peak quality spiritual weapon!"</p><p>Any weapons with a grade are considered precious treasures, as they are always many times stronger than normal weapons, especially weapons with higher quality.</p><p>And although Yuan's sword is only at the lowest grade, Spirit-grade, a peak quality weapon is something that even someone like Ren Fuchen, who is ranked 14th overall in this entire Sect, does not have.</p><p>Ren Fuchen frowned deeply after realizing that Yuan had a peak quality weapon whilst he only held a medium quality weapon. His attitude also changed, and he no longer looked at this situation as calmly as before. After all, he is already at a disadvantage before the fight even started! Compared to Yuan's peak quality weapon, his medium grade quality is akin to a wooden stick!</p><p>"What are you standing there for? If you don't want to fight then just say so." Yuan said to him when he doesn't move even after many moments, his voice with a hint of provocation.</p><p>'No! Although he has a superior weapon, I have the advantage in terms of Cultivation base! He's only a ninth level Spirit Apprentice whilst I am a fifth level Spirit Warrior! There's no way I could lose even if he has a peak quality weapon!' Ren Fuchen encouraged himself with such logic.</p><p>Even if Yuan has a peak quality weapon, if he does not have the Cultivation base to use its full potential, it will actually burden him instead.</p><p>"If you hand over that weapon as an apology, then I don't mind forgiving you for everything you've done up to this point, and I will even stop bothering Mo Zhou. How does that sound?"</p><p>Before Yuan could even open his mouth to speak, Xiao Hua opened her mouth for the first time, "Brother Yuan, this will be good practice for you. Although you have familiarized yourself with beasts, you have yet to fight another human and to be honest, you will most likely be fighting more humans than beasts in the future."</p><p>Yuan nodded and raised his sword to stand in an offensive stance. He had no intention of avoiding this fight, as he already considered this as an in-game event.</p><p>"Good! Then I shall take it off your dead body!"</p><p>Ren Fuchen roared as he charged towards Yuan with the sword in his grasp raised high in the air.</p><p>"Triple Sword Strike!"</p><p>Ren Fuchen connected three attacks together in the blink of an eye, making it seem as though he attacked three times with a single movement.</p><p>Yuan's eyes widened at his approach, but he was not shocked. Instead, he was watching Ren Fuchen's attack closely, almost as if he was analyzing it.</p><p>In the next instant, Yuan raised his sword, blocking all three strikes with a single move.</p><p>"What?!"</p><p>Ren Fuchen exclaimed in surprise after Yuan perfectly blocked his attack.</p><p>However, despite blocking it perfectly, Yuan was pushed back slightly from the power created by someone five whole levels above him.</p><p>"Amazing…"</p><p>Yuan looked at his trembling hands with a wide smile on his face.</p><p>"This tingly and numbing sensation… What a great feeling!"</p><p>Yuan, whose real body cannot feel anything, was excited to experience such a feeling for the first time, and it made him feel alive.</p><p>"Is he crazy?" Ren Fuchen looked at Yuan's smiling face and thought to himself.</p><p>"Come! Let's fight even more!"</p><p>It was Yuan's turn to be aggressive this time.</p><p>'Could Brother Yuan be a battle maniac?' Xiao Hua wondered to herself.</p><p>"Bloody Sword Strike!"</p><p>The blade of the sword suddenly glowed red, and killing intent filled the place.</p><p>"?!?!?!?!"</p><p>Ren Fuchen nearly crapped his pants when he realized that Yuan had just used an Earth-grade sword technique.</p><p>"Impossible! You are clearly only a Spirit Apprentice! How could you possibly use an Earth-grade sword technique!" He gasped in shock.</p><p>Ren Fuchen hastily raised his sword to block the incoming attack.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The moment their swords collided, Ren Fuchen felt as though he was clashing against a mountain, and his knees were forced to the ground by the tyrannical pressure pressing down on him!</p><p>The next instant, Ren Fuchen noticed cracks appearing across his sword.</p><p>"Not good! At this rate, he will break my weapon!"</p><p>"Help me!" he suddenly called out to his fellow disciple that had been on standby.</p><p>In the next moment, the disciple retrieved his sword and approached them at high speed.</p><p>"Daoist Yuan! Watch out!"</p><p>Mo Zhou couldn't react in time to block the disciple and yelled out loud to warn Yuan of the incoming danger.</p><p>However, Yuan did not even turn to look at the disciple and swung his sword, throwing Ren Fuchen many meters into the distance.</p><p>Once Ren Fuchen was out of the picture, Yuan turned to face the second disciple.</p><p>"Bloody Sword Strike!"</p><p>He activated the same skill and quickly swung his sword, sending an arc of light towards the surprised disciple.</p><p>The disciple, who was not the least prepared for such a strike, could only watch as the arc speed towards his direction and separate one of his limbs.</p><p>"AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!! MY ARM! MY ARM!!!"</p><p>The disciple dropped on the floor and screamed in agony while clutching the right side of his body.</p><p>"Oops…"</p><p>Yuan had acted purely on instinct and did not really mean to cut off the disciple's arm, even feeling bad for him afterward.</p>
