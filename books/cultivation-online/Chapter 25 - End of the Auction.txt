<p></p><p></p><p>"Elder Jia, we must buy this Heaven-grade treasure at all cost!" Xuan Wuhuan said to the old man beside her with a serious expression.</p><p>"I agree with the Young Lady. Although it might get expensive very fast, Heaven-grade treasures do not appear very often in this world, and this one appears to be of great quality, too."</p><p align="center" class="adsbox" id="lightnovelpub_Billboard_Inlist_1"></p><p>"Du Hai, this treasure…"</p><p>"Of course, we are going to try and bid for it! Even though we might not win, we cannot simply sit here and do nothing while there is such a treasure before us!" Du Hai spoke with a regrettable face.</p><p>Although the Du Family has decent wealth, compared to the other esteemed guests in the V.I.P room, their wealth is nothing significant. However, even if there's the slightest chance they could buy the Heaven-grade treasure, they will surely try.</p><p>The V.I.P room quickly became chaotic, and everybody there looked at the Heavenly Frost Dagger with lustful eyes.</p><p>Even if they have to use all of their money and replace the food on their dinner table with water for the next ten years, they felt that it would all be worth it if they obtained the treasure.</p><p>Once the anticipation within the auction house was at its maximum, Madam Chang spread her arms and spoke with a wide smile, "Then without further ado, let the bidding for this peak quality Heavenly Frost Dagger begin at 10 million gold!"</p><p>Despite the outrageous price, the people at the auction house began bidding like animals.</p><p>"11 million gold!"</p><p>"11.5 million gold!"</p><p>"13 million gold!"</p><p>Within minutes, the minimum price for the Heavenly Frost Dagger increased to 21 million gold.</p><p>"21 million gold…" Yuan listened to the biddings with a dazed face, seemingly in disbelief.</p><p>He cannot even begin to imagine what he could do with that much wealth.</p><p>"25 million gold!" Xuan Wuhuan suddenly shouted.</p><p>The sudden high bid by Xuan Wuhuan slowed the bidding pace briefly, but after a few moments, it returned to normal.</p><p>When the bidding reached 30 million gold, the pace finally slowed down permanently, as only very few individuals there could afford to bring out so much money.</p><p>"30.5 million!"</p><p>Of course, Xuan Wuhan, whose family belonged to the business circle, was one of these rich individuals.</p><p>"31 million!"</p><p>"31.5 million!"</p><p>After a few more minutes of bidding from the same three people, a new voice suddenly resounded.</p><p>"40 million gold."</p><p>The voice was profoundly calm, causing everybody in the V.I.P room to turn to look at the person who just spoke.</p><p>However, that person had not been in the V.I.P room since the beginning, and the people there wondered when this person arrived.</p><p>"T-That's Qi Jiguang from Heaven and Earth Palace! What's he doing in this place?!" Someone there exclaimed after realizing his identity.</p><p>"What?! The Heaven and Earth Palace?!" Although most people there were unfamiliar with the name Qi Jiguang, they all gasped in shock after hearing the name 'Heaven and Earth Palace'.</p><p>"That man is at the peak of the Spirit Grandmaster. He's considered as a peak expert in the Lower Heavens." Xiao Hua mumbled to Yuan, who seemed to be dazed by the profound aura surrounding this Qi Jiguang.</p><p>"I wonder what it would be like to fight someone as powerful as him…" Yuan said in a low voice.</p><p>Xiao Hua looked at him with raised eyebrows. "As expected of a battle junkie. In this entire room, you are probably the only one thinking such a thing, Brother Yuan. But at your current cultivation, you won't even last a second against a single finger from him. You'll die instantly."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>When Qi Jiguang noticed the two of them looking at him, he also looked back.</p><p>Although there was nothing out of the ordinary about Yuan, he could sense an invisible yet formidable aura coming from Xiao Hua.</p><p>'That little girl… I cannot see her cultivation base, but she's without a doubt an expert like me.' Qi Jiguang thought to himself.</p><p>While her presence piqued his interest, he did not want to involve himself with another expert at his level without any good reason, as that might lead to unnecessary confrontation.</p><p>Many moments have passed since Qi Jiguang bid 40 million gold for the Heavenly Frost Dagger without anyone else trying to outbid him.</p><p>'Damn it! Why did someone like him have to appear here today?!' Xuan Wuhuan cried inwardly. While she had the ability to continue bidding, she did not want to fight against someone from the Heaven and Earth Palace and accidentally offend him, as that would be devastating for her family and its business.</p><p>"Since there doesn't seem to be any more bidders, the bid for this Heaven-grade treasure shall come to an end! Congratulations to the esteemed guest for winning this exquisite treasure!" Madam Chang clapped with smiles all over her face, as she just earned 4 million gold from this transaction alone.</p><p>After the auction ended, Xuan Wuhan said to Yuan, "If you ever need anything, come find me at Spring City. You can show anyone the medallion I gave you, and they will lead you to me. I hope to see you again later, Yuan."</p><p>The Du Brothers glanced at Yuan with narrowed eyes for a moment before leaving the place.</p><p>Sometime later, Na Ying approached them after the auction ended and said, "Esteemed Guests, please follow me to claim your sales."</p><p>Yuan nodded and proceeded to follow her to a private room at the top of the auction house.</p><p>"Madam Chang will be here in a few moments with your earnings, please relax in the meantime." Na Ying said to them as she poured them a cup of spiritual tea.</p><p>«You have gained the following effect from consuming Phoenix Blossom Tea»</p><p>«Increased Qi Absorption Rate by 10% for 12 hours»</p><p>«Soul Strength +500 permamently»</p><p>Yuan gained some stats after drinking the tea.</p>
