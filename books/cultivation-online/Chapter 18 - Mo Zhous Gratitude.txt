<p></p><p></p><p>After standing there and pondering for a moment, Yuan decided that it would be better for him and Mo Zhou to just acknowledge being a disciple from the Blood Sect.</p><p>"That's right, I am indeed from the Blood Sect," he said with a confident voice.</p><p align="center" class="adsbox" id="lightnovelpub_Billboard_Inlist_1"></p><p>"And I don't mind pretending what happened today did not occur, but you have to promise me that my friend, Mo Zhou, will no longer be bullied by his fellow disciples."</p><p>"Daoist Yuan!" Mo Zhou couldn't believe his ears and began crying. Why would Yuan go this far for him when he didn't do anything to really deserve this treatment?</p><p>"Mo Zhou, huh?" The Sect Leader turned to look at Mo Zhou for a moment before saying, "You will be my disciple starting today! Anyone who dares to touch you will have to answer me!"</p><p>"What?!"</p><p>When the Sect Leader made his announcement, everybody there gasped in shock, Mo Zhou included.</p><p>"Greet your new Master!" The Sect Leader continued.</p><p>Mo Zhou immediately kowtowed on the ground and bowed to him.</p><p>"This disciple greets Master!"</p><p>"Good! Starting today, you will be training under me!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Mo Zhou replied with enthusiasm in his voice.</p><p>Although Yuan did not expect such an outcome yet again, he was more than satisfied.</p><p>"Then I will be taking my leave," he said.</p><p>The Sect Leader nodded and looked at Mo Zhou again, "Go guide our guest to the exit!"</p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p>Thus, Mo Zhou brought Yuan and Xiao Hua away from the crowd.</p><p>Once they were gone, Sect Elder Jiang spoke, "Sect Leader… making Mo Zhou your disciple is a little bit…"</p><p>"Hmph!" The Sect Leader coldly snorted. "If you hadn't noticed by now, the sword technique used by that child is one of the Blood Sect's most powerful technique!"</p><p>"What?! Does this mean—"</p><p>"That child is definitely not just your average disciple from the Blood Sect. Judging from his prowess and ability to fight those many realms above himself, I won't be surprised if his Master is the Blood Sect's Master himself, Lord Blood!"</p><p>"Lord Blood!" Elder Jiang trembled in fear just by hearing his name.</p><p>"And if someone like him calls Mo Zhou his 'friend', then there's a high possibility that the Blood Sect will help us if we are ever in danger because of their relationship. If that's the case, then I won't hesitate to make him my disciple, even if it will make many disciples unhappy!"</p><p>Elder Jiang stared at him with a gaze filled with admiration. 'To think that the Sect Leader would be thinking so far ahead just to keep his Sect safe! It's no wonder why he's the Sect Leader!'</p><p>"Sect Leader is sharp and wise, to think I doubted your decision even for a moment. Please, forgive me."</p><p>"If you want to be forgiven, then take care of the rest of this mess!" The Sect Leader said before walking away.</p><p>The news of Mo Zhou, a mere Outer Court disciple, suddenly becoming the Sect Leader's disciple came out of the blue and shocked every disciple within the Flying Swords Sect, especially those already at the top.</p><p>"What?! How could a nobody like Mo Zhou be chosen as the Sect Leader's disciple when the rest of us have been working our asses off just for that spot?!"</p><p>"The Heavens are unjust! This world is unfair!"</p><p>No doubt many people began to despise Mo Zhou because of his luck and bullshit, but alas, with the Sect Leader behind his back, who would dare to touch him now?</p><p>Outside the Flying Sword Sect, Mo Zhou dropped to his knees and kowtowed to Yuan, who was slightly taken back by his behavior.</p><p>"What are you doing?" Yuan tried to lift him off the floor.</p><p>"Daoist— No! Brother Yuan! Everything you have done for me, I do not know if I will ever be able to repay you but I will do my best as the Sect Leader's disciple and will one day return this debt!"</p><p>Yuan smiled and casually waved his hands, "Don't worry about it. Like I'd already said many times, I am not doing this because I want any reward."</p><p>"No! This is not a reward! I am doing this because I want to, just like you!" he quickly responded.</p><p>Yuan could tell that Mo Zhou will not change his mind no matter what he says at this point so he only shook his head inwardly and accepted the outcome.</p><p>"Fine, do whatever you want."</p><p>"I will!"</p><p>"And good luck with that girl you fancy, I'm rooting for you."</p><p>"R-Right…" Mo Zhou began blushing.</p><p>"Then, I'll be leaving. I have already caused too much trouble in your place."</p><p>Yuan began walking away.</p><p>"Take care, Brother Yuan!" Mo Zhou waved at him from the Flying Sword Sect.</p><p>A few moments later, after Yuan left the Flying Sword Sect, messages appeared before his eyes:</p><p>«Congratulations! You have unlocked the Bond System!»</p><p>«'Mo Zhou' has been added to your Bond!»</p><p>«Mo Zhou's Bond level has increased to Acquaintance!»</p><p>«Mo Zhou's Bond level has increased to Friend!»</p><p>«Mo Zhou's Bond level has increased to Brotherhood!»</p><p>«Congratulations! Your Bond level with Mo Zhou has reached Brotherhood!»</p><p>«You have gained the following effect from Mo Zhou's Bond level: 'Mo Zhou's Gratitude'»</p><p>«Mo Zhou's Gratitude: Increases Sword Mastery by 25% and Sword Damage by 10%»</p><p>«Sword Mastery: Increases your control when wielding swords»</p><p>«Sword Damage: Increases your damage when wielding swords»</p><p>«Congratulations! You have unlocked Associations!»</p><p>«'Flying Sword Sect' has been added to your Associations!»</p><p>«Because of the drama you've caused there, your relationship with 'Flying Sword Sect' has decreased drastically!»</p><p>«Because of your bond level with 'Mo Zhou', Prime Disciple of 'Flying Sword Sect', your relationship with 'Flying Sword Sect' has increased greatly!»</p><p>«Congratulations! You have unlocked Fame!»</p><p>«Due to your actions at 'Flying Sword Sect', your Fame has increased by 10!»</p><p>«Fame: Increases as you make a name for yourself.»</p><p>Yuan nearly received a headache from the number of notifications being spammed.</p><p>"Where should we go now?" Yuan asked Xiao Hua as they left the area.</p><p>"Hmm..." Xiao Hua pondered as their figures entered the forest.</p>
