Deemed hopeless and irredeemable, his parents quickly gave up on him, and the world ignored him.</p><p>In this dark and still world, his younger sister became his sole reason for living.</p><p>Watch as this young man reaches for the apex as a genius in Cultivation Online, the newest VRMMORPG, becoming a legendary figure in both worlds.</p><p>---------------------<br>Disclaimer: The MC is extremely overpowered and talented but also naive/innocent at first due to his illness. If you cannot wait for character developments and dislike OP MCs, this is not your cup of tea. Furthermore, the 'Earth' in this novel is not the same Earth we are currently living on so do not use our common sense for this novel. This is pure fantasy, after all.</p>
