<p></p><p></p><p>As they traveled further away from the Flying Sword Sect, Xiao Hua thought to herself, 'It's only been a few days since Brother Yuan became a Cultivator, yet he is already powerful enough to hold his own against Spirit Warriors, even though he's only a Ninth Level Spirit Apprentice. This kind of growth is unheard of and is terrifying, to say the least. His experience with the sword is also increasing at a frightening rate, almost like he's the reincarnation of a Sword Emperor.'</p><p>"Besides wandering around aimlessly for valuable resources and collecting monster cores, there is really nothing else to do."</p><p align="center" class="adsbox" id="lightnovelpub_Billboard_Inlist_1"></p><p>"Additionally, because Brother Yuan is already a Ninth Level Spirit Apprentice, he has to attain enlightenment before he can make a breakthrough and become a Spirit Warrior."</p><p>Xiao Hua turned to look at Yuan and spoke, "Brother Yuan, what would you like to do? Even if you keep consuming monster cores to fill your Qi, once you reach the peak of the Spirit Apprentice realm, you will not be able to gain more Qi unless you become a Spirit Warrior."</p><p>"How do I become a Spirit Warrior?" he asked her.</p><p>"To become a Spirit Warrior, you must comprehend the enlightenment that will come naturally once you reach the peak of the Spirit Apprentice realm. However, whether you will really gain enlightenment or not will depend on your fate and talent."</p><p>"What do you mean by that?"</p><p>Yuan expressed puzzlement.</p><p>"Although most people are born with the capability to cultivate, their max potential is predetermined before birth. For example, whilst Brother Yuan may be able to reach the peak of the Spirit Apprentice realm with ease, you might not gain enlightenment that is required to breakthrough to the Spirit Warrior realm, thus forever remaining a Spirit Apprentice."</p><p>"That being said, albeit valuable and hard to find, there are plenty of treasures out there that can help one exceed their limit and rewrite their fate."</p><p>Although she did not say it, Xiao Hua actually has a few of these treasures on her, so even if Yuan is destined to remain as a Spirit Apprentice forever, she can help him escape such a fate.</p><p>Yuan looked at his Qi Experience as he listened to Xiao Hua speak.</p><p>1,519,395/3,840,000</p><p>"If I consume 3 more monster cores, it should be more than enough to max out the Qi Experience…" Yuan thought to himself.</p><p>Suddenly, without thinking too much about it and excited to experience this enlightenment, Yuan retrieved three monster cores and threw them into his mouth all at once.</p><p>«Heaven Refining Physique activated»</p><p>«900,500 Qi has been refined from the Blood Ape's monster core»</p><p>«895,415 Qi has been refined from the Vampire Wolf's monster core»</p><p>«730,650 Qi has been refined from the Scaled Boar's monster core»</p><p>3,846,000/3,846,000</p><p>«You have absorbed enough Qi for a breakthrough»</p><p>«Because your Qi Experience is already full, you will not be able to receive anymore Qi until you reach the next realm»</p><p>The notifications disappeared for a few seconds before returning.</p><p>«You have met the requirements for a breakthrough»</p><p>«You have reached First Level Spirit Warrior»</p><p>«Your 'Enhanced Senses' has developed into 'Advanced Senses'»</p><p>«You have learned Enhanced Strength»</p><p>«All stats +1,000»</p><p>—</p><p>«Advanced Senses»</p><p>«Rank: Mortal»</p><p>«Description: Sharply enhances the functions of all available senses permanently. Requires no activation»</p><p>—</p><p>«Enhanced Strength»</p><p>«Rank: N/A»</p><p>«Description: Greatly enhances your strength and stamina»</p><p>Once Yuan has reached the Spirit Warrior realm, he could feel a large amount of profound energy expanding in this body; it made him feel as though his body had increased in size despite having no changes made to his actual body.</p><p>"..."</p><p>Xiao Hua stared at Yuan with eyes as wide as two round eggs, her cute and round face filled with shock and disbelief.</p><p>"B-B-Brother Yuan… Y-Y-You…"</p><p>She couldn't believe what she'd just witnessed!</p><p>Although the Spirit Warrior realm is nothing special in her eyes and could be easily disregarded, Yuan had actually managed to become a Spirit Warrior without any enlightenment! Such an achievement was unprecedented even in the higher Heavens!</p><p>"B-Brother Yuan… what did you just do?" she asked him in a trembling voice.</p><p>"Hm? But I didn't do anything? Just like before, I had enough Qi for a breakthrough, and before I could even react, I had already become a Spirit Warrior."</p><p>Yuan responded, sounding somewhat disappointed that he did not get to experience this 'enlightenment'.</p><p>"Unbelievable…"</p><p>Xiao Hua still couldn't believe it. Just what kind of cultivating prodigy is Yuan? Hell, calling him a prodigy is still an understatement considering what he'd just accomplished!</p><p>While Xiao Hua was dumbfounded by his achievements, Yuan looked at his current stats.</p><p>Cultivation: First Level Spirit Warrior</p><p>Legacy: None</p><p>Bloodline: None</p><p>Physique: Heaven Refining Physique</p><p>Physical Strength: 3,734‬</p><p>Mental Strength: 3,975</p><p>Soul Strength: 4,910</p><p>Physical Defense: 3,710</p><p>Mental Defense: 4,821‬</p><p>Qi Experience: 3,846,000/38,460,000</p><p>"38 million?! I need 38 million Qi for the next level?! This is ridiculous!"</p><p>Yuan felt slightly dizzy after seeing the long numbers and sudden spike in the Qi required for the next level.</p><p>"I might as well eat the rest of the monster cores right now!"</p><p>Yuan retrieved all of his remaining monster cores and tossed it into his mouth.</p><p>However, what happened next dumbfounded him greatly.</p><p>«Heaven Refining Physique activated»</p><p>«Because you have consumed a monster core that is not suitable for your cultivation base, the overall absorbed Qi will be reduced by 90%»</p><p>«88,000 Qi has been refined from the Blood Ape's monster core»</p><p>«82,500 Qi has been refined from the Vampire Wolf's monster core»</p><p>«70,500 Qi has been refined from the Scaled Boar's monster core»</p><p>«85,000 Qi has been refined from the Vampire Wolf's monster core»</p><p>«65,000 Qi has been refined from the Hairy Serpent's monster core»</p><p>«66,700 Qi has been refined…»</p><p>«54,650 Qi has been refined…»</p><p>Qi Experience: 4,500,000/38,460,000</p><p>"W-W-What the hell?! Why am I barely getting any Qi from the monster cores now?!"</p><p>Xiao Hua's voice responded to his puzzlement a few moments later, "Because Brother Yuan is now a Spirit Warrior, any monster core that is not from a Spirit Warrior beast will no longer be as effective."</p><p>"N-No way… but that makes no sense!"</p><p>"Brother Yuan's existence also makes no sense…" Xiao Hua sighed.</p><p>After calming down and thinking about it for a moment, Yuan realized that such a system was actually quite logical and fair, as it would prevent those with power that far exceeded this area's level range from taking advantage of the weak too much and force them to hunt stronger monsters.</p><p>"Well, this is a good time to take a break from cultivation, since I am starting to get tired of all this hunting… mentally..." he thought to himself.</p><p>"Xiao Hua, can you lead us to the nearest city? We can talk about our plans after we take a break."</p><p>Xiao Hua nodded and said, "The nearest city is 10 kilometers away."</p><p>"10 kilometers… let's run there."</p><p>Having never felt this energetic before, Yuan suggested running there.</p><p>"Okay." Xiao Hua easily agreed.</p><p>Thus, the two began running towards the nearest city.</p>
