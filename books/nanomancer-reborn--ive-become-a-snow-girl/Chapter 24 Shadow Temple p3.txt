<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>[Fabrication Complete] </p><p>Product = Remotely Activated Atomic Mana Pulse Bomb – MP cost = 100,000,000 </p><p>That being said, just relying on this bomb couldn't solve everything. With the insane MP cost, the most she could do is to just set it off once. </p><p>Forming a relation with the fire empress would still be advised. </p><p>However, just one bomb isn't enough to convince them, she also needed several. The most optimal number would be two. </p><p>With two, they would have the mental thought that she may have another. With that thought implanted, they can't risk it thus granting her a natural advantage over the relations. </p><p>'First step is to send out a message to the fire queen. Ask for a join operation as the thunder king is the biggest threat. Suggest to her that I have something to show my power and she would be collateral if she rejects.' Shiro thought. </p><p>"But… it'll be a waste to not make the most of my time here." She muttered. </p><p>Being set in a situation like this could provide her with more opportunities. </p><p>Martial Arts, technological theories, mana manipulation and most importantly, skills for her ice magic. </p><p class="pdtehg"></p><p>Since she was focused on nanomancery in her past life, she had no experience with ice magic outside of the rudimentary level. Whilst she did have theories for reaching extreme essences of ice for it to start 'burning', that was too far down the line that it wouldn't help for the time being. </p><p>Her current arsenal with the ice was very simple, a field which makes it efficient, spears, pillars and the such. She was just throwing ice at people rather than using them to the best abilities. </p><p>Walking around the castle, Shiro tried to look for Fei Ling but paused when she realised an important fact. </p><p>She was lost… </p><p>"….f*ck." Was all she could mutter realising this. </p><p>Mustering up mana, Shiro wanted to use ice but realised her mana was that of the shadow attribute. </p><p>"Hmm…. If that's the case then this might work." She muttered as a dark purple mist surrounded her. </p><p>Walking towards the wall, her body started to flow into the gaps and walked towards the throne room. </p><p>Seeing the void beast still there, she sighed in relief. </p><p class="pdtehg"></p><p>"Void Beast, can you go call Fei Ling for me?" Shiro said, not sure if the beast could understand her. </p><p>Thankfully, it did as it nodded and started to leave. </p><p>Sitting back onto the throne, Shiro started to plan out her course of action. </p><p>Stage 1: Gather the needed mana for the atomic mana pulse bomb. </p><p>Stage 2: Send a messenger to form relations with the fire queen. </p><p>Stage 3: Detonate the bomb in the thunder kings army to weaken them. </p><p>This was her plan of action in a nutshell. In between each stage, she would need to work hard to make it a success. </p><p>"You called for me my liege?" Fei Ling said as she bowed. </p><p>"I need your help with a task. I need to send a message to the fire queen about a friendly treaty. Also, I want you to help me gather books about the use of ice magic, martial arts and technological theories." Shiro said as Fei Ling nodded. </p><p class="pdtehg"></p><p>"In which order do you wish that I fulfil these tasks?" </p><p>"Help me gather the books first and the public donations. After that, you can send the message to her." Shiro said as Fei Ling nodded. </p><p>Sitting on the throne, Shiro felt a little idle. She was just waiting for the jobs to be done and not partaken in the jobs themselves. </p><p>"Hmm…. Maybe I should learn some martial arts to improve my close quarter combat." Shiro muttered as this spare time gave her a moment to think to herself. </p><p>Closing her eyes, she decided to recount the times she had seen the hero and her party members fight. </p><p>Their use of recoil, their use of momentum shift, the centre of gravity, battle instincts and finally, force shift. </p><p>Each and every one of them can help a person dramatically should they now even just a little. </p><p>Remembering a routine the fighter of their party once did, Shiro walked off the throne and crouched low. </p><p>In slow steady movements, she lifted up her left arm to the height of her head and the right arm in front for the attack. </p><p class="pdtehg"></p><p>'Lock the joints before the attack, store the kinetic force. Like a gun, hammer out the force in one go!' Shiro thought as she slowly reeled her right arm back. </p><p>Moving into a stance with a strong centre of gravity. Shiro took a deep breath in and out as her iris's narrowed. </p><p>Punching forward, Shiro used a little too much strength as the momentum carried her body with it a little. </p><p>She frowned before looking at her hands. </p><p>'My body isn't suited for power combat. I need a counter force martial art style. Preferably one to do with flexibility.' She thought. </p><p>Her current close combat didn't include any styles as she was just barely able to shift her momentum. Her natural advantage would be her instant acceleration. </p><p>The ability to go from 0 speed to max speed in a single short burst. </p><p>While she couldn't use the ability to her fullest due to the new body, she still remembered the sensation, therefore, making it easier for her. </p><p>In the time of her musing, Fei Ling returned with a stack of doc.u.ments. </p><p class="pdtehg"></p><p>"My liege, here are the books you asked for. I found every book regarding to ice magic, technological theories and the most suitable martial arts manuals for you." Fei Ling said placing the books down. </p><p>"Thanks." Shiro smiled. </p><p>"It was but a simple task. The letter and the hawk are ready. You may write the details and send it off at any moment you want." </p><p>Shiro nodded as she picked up the ice magic books. </p><p>Seeing the contents, she smiled bitterly as the book was a blur. </p><p>'Of course it won't be this easy.' Shiro thought as she had another way of getting what she wants. </p><p>"Fei Ling, what martial arts do you use?" Shiro asked. </p><p>"I use the Yin Style Phantom Arts." </p><p>"Do explain the style to me. I'm rather interested." Shiro said as Fei Ling nodded. </p><p class="pdtehg"></p><p>"The Yin Style Phantom Arts are a set of martial arts designed for women. It requires excellent flexibility and counter judgement. The main focus is to not be hit like a phantom while striking a shock through their bodies. </p><p>When we are hit, we redirect the force in the shape of momentum and strike back at our enemies. </p><p>However, that is the fail-safe of the Yin Style Phantom Arts. We should try to not get hit at all if that is possible. The users of this style are like a phantom. Silent yet powerful, without form yet corporeal." Fei Ling replied. </p><p>"Oh? Do you think my body suits this type of martial arts?" Shiro asked with interest. </p><p>"My liege is a mage, therefore I cannot say. But, I believe with enough effort, one can learn anything even if it's just the rudimentary." Fei Ling replied honestly. </p><p>"Very well. Since that is the case, why don't you show me the entire Yin Style Phantom Arts?" Shiro smiled. Her memory was incredible so she believes she can remember this style even when she leaves. </p><p>As Lyrica had previously stated, take advantage of what you can, WHILE you can. </p><p>Fei Ling nodded as she stepped away and walked to the centre of the room. </p><p>"The Phantom Arts revolves around 5 main concepts. 1st Phantom, illusionary phantom. 2nd Phantom, speed phantom. 3rd Phantom, counterweight phantom. 4th Phantom, internal feasting phantom. 5th Phantom, the soul stealing phantom." Fei Ling said as Shiro nodded, recording this into her database. </p><p class="pdtehg"></p><p>"The illusionary phantom takes advantage of blind spots and misdirection. You are a mirage, so close yet so far." </p><p>Shifting her leg a little, Fei Ling raised her arms as she moved in a flowing motion. Before Shiro realised, Fei Ling was already in front of her. </p><p>"Trick the eyes, trick the mind. Strike at the weakness." </p><p>"Second Phantom. Speed Phantom. A set of footwork that focuses on minimal usage for the biggest gain. The constant contraction and the relaxation of your muscles." </p><p>In a blink of an eye, Fei Ling was already across the room. </p><p>"Third Phantom. Counterweight phantom. This form focuses on the art of redirection as we primarily use the legs to counter. Fourth Phantom. The internal feasting phantom. We focus our strikes like a needle to damage the weakened body being the tough outer shell. Fifth Phantom. Soul stealing phantom. Pure attack, no defence. Go for the kill and nothing less." </p><p>Seeing her demonstrate each of the moves, Shiro made sure to record everything down. </p><p>A few hours passed in a flash as Fei Ling was patient enough to teach her all the moves. </p><p>Closing her eyes, Shiro absorbed the knowledge as she thought about combining a few moves with her current arsenal. </p><p class="pdtehg"></p><p>"Fei Ling. Let's have a little spar." Shiro said as Fei Ling didn't understand. </p><p>"My liege, you can overwhelm me easily. Why is there a need for a spar?" </p><p>"Because I wish to test out what I've learnt." Shiro's voice rang out from behind Fei Ling as she shivered. </p><p>Her guard was dropped for a moment as Shiro had already managed to get behind her using the illusory phantom in the most basic form. </p><p>"As you wish my liege." Fei Ling replied as they separated. </p><p>They didn't get into any stance as there were no basic stances for the Phantom Arts. </p><p>They had to flexible and adapt to change. From no stance to every stance. They must not stick to anything like the shape of a phantom. Forever changing. </p><p>'First Phantom: Illusionary Phantom!' </p><p>Their body faded for a moment before reappearing in front of each other. Fei Ling was able to continuously get behind Shiro causing her to frown. </p><p class="pdtehg"></p><p>'Second Phantom: Speed Phantom!' </p><p>Tapping lightly on the ground, Shiro landed on the ceiling before rebounding towards Fei Ling. </p><p>She casually stepped sideways as she bent her leg towards Shiro. </p><p>'Third Phantom: Counterweight Phantom!' </p><p>Twisting her body, Shiro kicked similarity and redirected Fei Ling's kick. </p><p>*CRACK!!! </p><p>Fei Ling was astonished as she never believed anyone could be able to learn a set of martial arts this well in a few hours. Albeit a little on the rudimentary side, it was never the less impressive of her. </p><p>'Fourth Phantom: Internal Feasting Phantom!' </p><p>Shiro narrowed her eyes as she pivoted on her right leg as a central point before striking downwards with her left leg. </p><p class="pdtehg"></p><p>Fei Ling smiled slightly before stepping back just before the kick hit. </p><p>The only downside to Shiro would be her lack of reach. Her area of influence was rather short as she had to get close and personal to make the most of her skills. </p><p>Even though Fei Ling dodged her kick, Shiro didn't mind as she could transaction into another attack. </p><p>Changing the kick into a stomp, Shiro c.o.c.ked her elbow as force gathered in her arms. </p><p>Punching forwards, Fei Ling dodged into the fist and almost phased through like a phantom. </p><p>Tapping Shiro's inner elbow and pushing the fist, Fei Ling redirected the force. </p><p>"Tsk." Shiro clicked her tongue as she pivoted on her foot and increased her momentum to kick towards her head. </p><p>Fei Ling kept her composure as she crouched down and supported her entire both with just her right arm. </p><p>Placing her left foot behind Shiro's knee, she gently kicked Shiro's torso forcing her attack away. </p><p class="pdtehg"></p><p>Flipping backwards, Shiro created some distance as she had a grin on her face. </p><p>This was the martial arts she wanted. It fit with her fighting style as well due to the high requirements for body control and flexibility. </p><p>"My liege, you are a genius for understanding the rudimentary of the Yin Style Phantom Arts in a short while. However, do keep in mind the weakness of the Phantom Arts. Our reach, defence and the overall attacking options. The Phantom Arts are primarily used for countering therefore, unless they are the attacking force, our exhibited power is reduced by a lot." Fei Ling said with a bow. </p><p>"Are you able to write a quick page about the Phantom Art's?" Shiro asked. </p><p>"Indeed, I can." Fei Ling nodded and grabbed a piece of paper before starting to write down the Phantom Arts. </p><p>"Just a page will do." Shiro reminded as she wanted to see if she could see the contents. </p><p>Looking at the blurred writing, Shiro could only sigh as this meant that she'll have to develop her proficiency in the phantom arts later. </p><p>"Forget about this. I'll send the letter to the fire queen." Shiro said as she sat on the throne and crossed her legs. </p><p>Writing down the letter, she gave it to Fei Ling to be sent. </p><p>[Time remaining until ever army surrounds Yin Kingdom : 3 days] </p>
