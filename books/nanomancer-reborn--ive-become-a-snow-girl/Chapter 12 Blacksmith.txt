<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>[I'll be exploring the town a little today so I won't be back until late.] Shiro wrote down as Lyrica nodded. </p><p>"Ok, take care Shiro." She replied. </p><p>Leaving the school in her uniform, Shiro walked towards the Blacksmiths association. </p><p>On her way there, she saw a familiar figure patrolling the streets. </p><p>Walking towards him with a light smile, she tapped his arm like the first time she saw him. </p><p>[Thank you for your help last time Liam.] Shiro wrote down while Liam looked towards her. </p><p>"Ah so it was you miss Shiro." Liam smiled. </p><p>"You've already learnt how to read and write?! That was fast." Liam complimented. </p><p>[I had a friend to help me study after all.] </p><p>"Hou~ Already made a friend huh. Nice going." Liam smiled. </p><p class="vxulyh"></p><p>[Anyways, I was here just to say thanks so I won't bother you on your duty any longer.] Shiro smiled giving him a wave before leaving. </p><p>Liam only smiled before he carried on his duty. </p><p>Reaching the Blacksmiths association, Shiro walked up to the counter. </p><p>[Hello, I would like to check the prices for commissioning a custom weapon.] </p><p>"For that, you'll need to ask the individual craftsmen for their prices depending on what your weapon is. The craftsmen are over to the left." The receptionist said simply. </p><p>Walking through the area of craftsmen, she would occasionally check out their wares and see the quality of the weapons they're producing. </p><p>'Hmm… each of these weapons are in poor condition.' Shiro thought examining the weapons. </p><p>Picking out the blacksmith who seemed to have the best quality, Shiro lined up. </p><p>However, the queue moved at such an abysmal pace that even Shiro was getting impatient. </p><p class="vxulyh"></p><p>In the time she was waiting, Shiro decided to pull up her tablet and browse the net on information around the surrounding Dungeons. </p><p>'There are around 28 E ranked Dungeons nearby. Each of these Dungeons ranged from the lowest being level 2 and the highest being level 20. The Dungeon I was in was a level 10 to 15 Dungeon that mutated into a level 20 Dungeon.' Shiro thought reading about the Dungeon. </p><p>'As for D ranks, there are 15 Dungeons. 5 being level 21 to level 35. 3 being level 35 to level 40. And finally, the last seven are level 40 to level 50.' </p><p>She was currently level 21 so she was still a while away from level 50. </p><p>Waiting in line took an hour before Shiro finally reached the front. </p><p>"What do you need? Keep it quick." The person who said this was a man who looked like he was in his early 20's. He had flaming red hair and red eyes. His hair was short and spiky. Measuring around 6ft 4 and looking around 20 to 25 years old in age, he wore a blacksmith's uniform. </p><p>*DING DING DING DING </p><p>He hammered away at the metal rhythmically. </p><p>[Helion LVL 50 – Pugilist] </p><p class="vxulyh"></p><p>Shiro wrote something down before tapping his arm. </p><p>"If ya need something just say it." He said not turning around. </p><p>'In hindsight, I should have brought Lyrica with me.' Shiro thought. </p><p>Shiro decided to walk around the bench as she stood in front of him and showed him the note. </p><p>[I want to commission a custom weapon for my friend. The handle should be around 30cm with two blades attached to either side of the handle. The blades themselves should resemble longswords. Also I'm mute so I can't talk.] </p><p>*CLANG! </p><p>Helion dropped his hammer immediately seeing the girl in front of him. She had clear azure eyes and long flowing black hair. Her height was 5ft 3 and a modest body build. Holding the sign in front of him, she seemed almost defenceless. </p><p>Seeing his reaction, Shiro furrowed her brows slightly and wrote down another sentence. </p><p>[Excuse me?] </p><p class="vxulyh"></p><p>Shiro waved her hand in front of his face causing him to snap out of it. </p><p>"Ah em. Well, er can you tell me what you mean by the weapon?" Helion said as he coughed slightly. </p><p>Shiro took out the handle and remade the Ice dual ended blade Lyrica used. </p><p>[The blade looks like this.] Shiro wrote down handing him the weapon. </p><p>"Hmm, it's definitely an uncommon weapon." Helion said whilst he inspected the weapon. </p><p>"What level is your friend?" He asked. </p><p>[Level 12.] </p><p>"Level 12… So it should be more worthwhile to make a level 15 weapon rather than 10. Hmm… What types of attributes does your friend need the most?" He asked looking over at her. </p><p>Seeing Shiro look down and start writing on the notepad, he couldn't help but admire her a little longer. </p><p class="vxulyh"></p><p>[I'm estimating the stats she needs are AGI, STR and DEX since she's a swordswoman.] Shiro wrote down. </p><p>[So what materials do I need?] She asked. </p><p>"It really depends. The higher level the source of the material, the higher level the weapon will be. So I'd say you're looking for serpents scales, scorpion stingers, bear bones, a core and a E rank mana stone." He replied as he started to draft up a design. </p><p>"What do you think?" He asked eagerly. </p><p>Shiro was slightly taken aback at how fast he worked. </p><p>The design showed the bear bones being used as the handle with the core and E rank mana stone slotted in the bone marrow. The scorpion stingers and the serpent scales mixed together to make the blades causing the dual ended sword itself to look menacing. </p><p>[How much is it?] </p><p>"Erm it's all on–" </p><p>*Tap tap tap </p><p class="vxulyh"></p><p>Shiro tapped three times on the notepad to get his attention on the note. She wasn't about to let him say it's all on me. </p><p>"5,000 USD deposit and it should be around 75,000 USD." Helion replied as to not displease the young girl in front of him. </p><p>[Ok, give me a list of the number of materials so I can keep an eye out for them.] Shiro wrote down while Helion took a pen and started to write the materials down. </p><p>[List Of materials] </p><p>20x Scorpion Stingers </p><p>50x Rock Serpent Scales </p><p>2x Tough Bear Bones </p><p>5x Red Gems </p><p>1x E Rank Mana Stone </p><p class="vxulyh"></p><p>[Thank you.] Shiro wrote down before she started to walk away. </p><p>'Rock Serpent Scales can be obtained in the Dungeon near the school. Tough Bear Bones can be obtained back in the Dungeon I woke up in.' Shiro thought since she would have to clear quite a few Dungeons to get everything she needs. </p><p>'Not to mention, I need around 75,000 USD to pay for weapon.' </p><p>She sighed as she decided to see how much money her level 15 Blue Grade greatsword would give her. </p><p>Walking to the auction house once more, she tapped away at the terminal and found the weapon section. </p><p>[Level 15 Weapons] </p><p>Serpent's Fang LVL 15 (Green) Sword – 28,000 USD </p><p>Scorpion's Stinger Knife LVL 15 (Green) Dagger – 30,000 USD </p><p>Golem's Fist LVL 15 (Green) Power Gauntlet – 30,000 USD </p><p class="vxulyh"></p><p>… </p><p>… </p><p>Howling Wolf's Claw LVL 15 (Blue) Claw Gauntlet – 150,000 USD </p><p>'Oh damn, 150,000 USD for a level 15 Blue Grade weapon. A claw weapon is a slightly unique weapon so it could either be more expensive or cheaper. A greatsword is more common so it should fetch a decent price.' Shiro thought. </p><p>'If I want to get the most out of this weapon, I'll need to factor in a few variables to make sure the price goes up.' Shiro thought bringing up her tablet and searched for any combat events that will happen soon. </p><p>'There is a Faction recruitment in a months time that will test the adventurers. I can probably hype up the weapon using this as leverage. Not to mention, the skill has a 100% increase in strength and 50% increase to damage. The -80% speed can be made up for using other equipment but the skill itself is pretty good even for people around level 30.' Shiro thought as she searched for a few key items she needed to take notice of. </p><p>Finding everything she needed, Shiro had a calculating glint in her eye. </p><p>[I wish to put a weapon on sale.] Shiro wrote down and showed it to the receptionist. </p><p>"If you wish to put an item on sale, please go to the second floor and ask the receptionist there." The receptionist lady replied. </p><p class="vxulyh"></p><p>Shiro nodded as she looked for a set of stairs. It didn't take too long since the staircase wasn't hidden at all. </p><p>Arriving on the second floor, Shiro was surprised at the sheer amount of people selling miscellaneous items. </p><p>'Maybe it's because the blacksmith's association is nearby.' She thought. </p><p>Clearing her head of these thoughts, she walked towards the receptionist. </p><p>[I wish to put a weapon on sale.] Shiro showed the receptionist the same note. </p><p>"Understood, please follow me to the inspection room." The receptionist replied, gesturing at Shiro for her to follow. </p><p>Waiting in the inspection room, Shiro waited for a few minutes until a woman walked in. </p><p>[Hilda LVL 35 – Ranger] </p><p>"So I heard you wanted to sell a weapon young girl. What do you have to sell?" Hilda asked. </p><p class="vxulyh"></p><p>Standing up, Shiro reached out her hands as she summoned the sword she received back in her first Dungeon. </p><p>[Fire Giant's Titanus Cleaver (Blue) LVL 15 – Greatsword </p><p>Requirements – 40 STR </p><p>+20 Sharpness </p><p>+15 Fire Element </p><p>+5 Ignore Defence </p><p>+5 Heavy Damage </p><p>-20 AGI </p><p>-5 Attack Speed </p><p class="vxulyh"></p><p>Skill – Fire Giant Empowerment </p><p>Fire Giant Empowerment - +100% strength, +50% damage, -80% speed </p><p>Duration – 1 minute </p><p>Cool Down – 5 minutes] </p><p>"A Blue Greatsword?!" Hilda exclaimed in surprise. Blue weapons that were put on a sale were rare. </p><p>Even then, most of them were uncommon weapons. </p><p>However, in front of her, laid a Blue grade level 15 greatsword that came with its own skill. Since the weapon is a more commonly used weapon, the prices would increase. </p><p>"Little girl, are you sure you want to put this weapon on sale?" Hilda asked looking over at Shiro. </p><p>[Yes I do. I'm an Ice mage so I have no use for a greatsword.] </p><p class="vxulyh"></p><p>"That is true… How about this, the auction house will give you 200,000 USD upfront if you sell this to us." Hilda said as Shiro shook her head. </p><p>'Does she think I'm just your everyday little girl?' Shiro thought. </p><p>[I wish to put it on bid so I can get the most out of this weapon. I still need to purchase some materials after this.] </p><p>"What if we trade you 200,000 USD and the materials you need for the greatsword." Hilda asked. </p><p>[400,000 USD and materials.] </p><p>Hilda frowned at the price. </p><p>"Too much. 200,000 USD and materials for the weapon." </p><p>[Miss Hilda, there is a Faction recruitment in a months time. Using that as an excuse, you can hype up the weapons actual value for more than 500,000 USD.] Shiro wrote down and smiled calmly. </p><p>She crossed her legs whilst waiting for Hilda's reply. </p><p class="vxulyh"></p><p>"Even so there is no guarantee that it will surpass 500,000 USD. 300,000 USD and materials and not a bit less." Hilda said as she realised the girl in front of her wasn't going to get tricked. </p><p>[Miss Hilda. May I remind you that the auction house isn't my only way to selling items. I can in fact wait until the Faction Recruitment to sell this. I wonder how much money I'll get by them?] Shiro smiled with slightly narrowed eyes. </p><p>Hilda became slightly nervous inside as Shiro was correct. They could make a fortune using the event. </p><p>"I'll have to ask my superiors about this." Hilda said as Shiro nodded. </p><p>[I'll wait 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, the deal is off.] </p><p>Hilda nodded, quickly leaving to call her superiors. </p><p>Shiro sat there calmly while she waited. Naturally, there is also the chance for them to try rob her, but she's already set up a few freezing traps to slow them down. She's also able to escape through a few narrow places using Faded Snow Movement. </p><p>Hilda returned after around 3 minutes. </p><p>"My superiors have agreed to your price of 400,000 USD and materials. Provided that they aren't too expensive." </p><p class="vxulyh"></p><p>[I need, 30x Scorpion's Poisoned Stinger. 50x Rock Serpent's Crown Scales. 2x Hobgoblin's Bones. 5x Element Gems. And a D rank mana stone.] Shiro wrote down causing Hilda to narrowed her eyes lightly. </p><p>"Too much. 300,000 USD and these materials." </p><p>[Then the deal is off.] Shiro wrote down decisively as she stood up and walked towards the door. </p><p>"Wait!" Hilda called up surprised that Shiro was so decisive. </p><p>[Miss Hilda. 450,000 USD and the materials. Not a bit less.] Shiro smiled. She had the upper hand in this arrangement so she had to take advantage of it. </p><p>Hilda frowned seeing the price rise once more. The quota her superior gave her was 500,000 USD and the materials she needed. </p><p>However, the total cost of materials must not surpass 150,000 USD. </p><p>"450,000 USD is fine. Though the materials are a little too much." Hilda said after a deep breath. </p><p>[Then how about 20x Scorpion's Poisoned Stinger. 50x Rock Serpent's Crown Scales. 2x Hobgoblin's Bones. 5x Reinforcement Gems and a D rank mana stone?] Shiro wrote down subtracting 10x Scorpion's Poisoned Stinger and downgraded the Element Gems slightly into Reinforcement Gems. </p><p class="vxulyh"></p><p>"That is fine." Hilda nodded as it was within her quota. </p><p>Finishing the trade, Shiro confirmed the items she received before leaving. </p><p>'Hehehe, my harvest isn't too bad.' Shiro thought with a grin. </p><p>The materials needed originally was the E rank versions of the materials she received in the end. This should make the weapon Helion creates much better and have a good chance of reaching Blue in ranks. The level requirement may also increase, but he can mix it with E rank materials to decrease the requirement. </p><p>Of course, it's also depended on the craftsmanship of the blacksmith himself. </p>
