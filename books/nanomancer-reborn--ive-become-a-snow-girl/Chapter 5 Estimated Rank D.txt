So that confirms my hypothesis. I won't die if the Dungeon Resets." Shiro said with a small smile after reading the requirements. </p><p>Walking calmly towards the obelisk, Shiro killed any Bears that tried to attack her. </p><p>There was a small benefit to trying to level up even though she reached LVL 20. She'll still get points per level, but it wouldn't be as much compared to the point bonus after Class Up. </p><p>Right now, she'll get 5 points per pseudo level up. But if she levelled up after Class Up, she'll get 20 points instead. </p><p>Each level after Class Up is equivalent to four pseudo level ups. However, the exp needed to level up would still be the same. Therefore, it is always advised for people to aim for Class Up. </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>A consequence of not Classing Up would be needing several times the amount of exp compared to others when levelling up from 21 to 22. </p><p>This is due to the fact that the person would have acc.u.mulated several pseudo levels thus increasing the amount of exp needed. </p><p>As if understanding the danger Shiro possessed, the Bears started to back away while she walked calmly towards the [Leader Class] without any hindrances. </p><p>"Hey there big guy. Remember me?" Shiro said looking at the hulking 3 meter Bear in front of her. </p><p>[Fire Spirit Infused Bear LVL 20 – Leader Class – Empowered] </p><p>The bear had experienced quite a few changes of his own as he had little to no fat on his body. His muscles were chiselled which served to make him more menacing. </p><p>What was Ice on his back now became a column of fire raging to the beat of his heart. His eyes glowed a menacing red as he focused on the tiny Snow Girl who stood in front of him. </p><p>"Wow~ You've been juicing up lately huh? I can barely see a scrap of fat on you." Shiro said holding her chin. </p><p>The Bear swiped his right paw towards her as Shiro smiled. </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>Jumping up, she landed on the top of the paw softly. </p><p>Running up the arm of the Bear, Shiro created a dagger in her hands. </p><p>[MP: 3550/4550] </p><p>Reaching near the head of the Bear, Shiro's eyes became cold as she plunged the dagger towards the eye. </p><p>The Bear tilted his head to avoid the dagger while he swiped his other paw at her. </p><p>Before the paw could build up any momentum, Shiro had already frozen a scaffold-like structure on the Bear's body stopping the paw. </p><p>"Come on~ Do you really expect me to let you hit me with that paw of yours? My frail body can't handle it ya know." Shiro grinned as her dagger destroyed the Bear's right eye. </p><p>Exhibiting great flexibility, Shiro stepped on the back of the dagger and kicked as hard as she could. </p><p>The force sent her through the air, but she landed softly with a smile. </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>[Fire Spirit Blessing Activated – For the next 20 seconds you will gain a 20% increase to magic damage and 20% increase to Fire damage.] </p><p>Clutching her hand, Shiro caused the dagger to blow up with all of the stored MP. </p><p>*BOOMMMMM!!! </p><p>The resulting explosion caused the ground to rumble as Shiro stumbled. Restabilising herself, she looked the head of the Bear. </p><p>"Ouch." Shiro muttered unconsciously since she could see parts of the Bear's skull. The muscle fibres were pulsing as they tried to join back together but failed. </p><p>*WRRAAAANNNN!!!! </p><p>The Bear roared in madness, charging towards Shiro. </p><p>Jumping onto the tree branch, Shiro jumped once more as she landed behind the Bear. </p><p>The Bear didn't turn around as the flames on his back grew larger. </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>Creating a block of Ice, Shiro hopped backwards whilst she saw the Ice block melt in mere seconds. </p><p>Raising both her arms slightly, two Ice Spears materialised as she threw them both towards the Bear. </p><p>After throwing the spears, she quickly created a third spear. </p><p>With a slight delay, she twisted her body and threw the third spear with all of her might. </p><p>The first two spears were aimed towards the arms of the Bear as the last one was aimed towards the chest. </p><p>*CRR CRR!!! </p><p>The first two spears made contacts and froze over instantly, locking both arms into the ground. </p><p>The last spear made contact as well. However, fire erupted around the Bear as he covered his entire body in a mass of flames. </p><p>"Shiro frowned seeing her plan go out the window. </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>The Bear roared, sending tens of fireballs hurling towards her. </p><p>Freezing the ground beneath her feet, Shiro started to skate around as her agility helped increase her momentum. </p><p>*BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOOM!!!! </p><p>Most of the fireballs missed but for the odd few which were on target, Shiro created her own Ice Bullet as it cancelled each other out. </p><p>Shiro narrowed her eyes whilst she crouched down and started to manually construct a ramp. </p><p>Under the paw, through the legs, around the back, over the head. </p><p>A roller coaster seemed to have been created as Shiro manoeuvred around the Bear causing it to not be able to lock onto her. </p><p>Little by little, an orb of Ice formed around the bear. Seeing the orb of Ice completed, Shiro made a ramp straight up. </p><p>Making two spears, she threw both of them with a slight gap between them. </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>The first spear was countered with a fire breath whilst the second one took its place. </p><p>Bringing her hands together, Shiro controlled the Ice Orb she created and fused it together with the second spear. This caused the weight of the spear to increase dramatically as it crushed the bear beneath it. </p><p>Not allowing it a moments rest, Shiro made a Nano Dagger and tried to decapitate the Bear whilst it couldn't retaliate. </p><p>She frowned as she saw the dagger fail to cut deeply into the neck. </p><p>"Che, we'll do this the hard way then big guy." Shiro said as she flicked her wrist and a second dagger materialised. </p><p>Stabbing the dagger through the tongue and jaw of the Bear, she froze it in place to make sure it couldn't move. </p><p>Making one more dagger, she twirled them both as she cut away at the face of the Bear. Layer by layer, the Bear's cries became more painful. </p><p>It tried to thrash around crazily but Shiro kept a constant supply of mana to the Ice locking the Bear down. This prevented the Bear from leaving since the Ice always regenerated. </p><p>The Bear had also tried to coat his body with fire, but the Ice was mostly concentrated near Shiro so it didn't melt as easily. He could only suffer while Shiro slowly killed it. </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>After a few minutes of constant attacking with her two daggers, Shiro panted heavily seeing the Bear finally die. </p><p>The skull of the Bear had lost most of its flesh as Shiro scr.a.p.ed it to the bone and destroyed the brain. </p><p>"Pui! What a pain." Shiro said spitting out some blood that got into her mouth. </p><p>Standing up, she dismissed the ice. Carving a hole through the torso leading to where the heart would be, Shiro frowned when she realised she couldn't reach it due to her small arm length. </p><p>"Ha…." She sighed with fatigue as she brought up her two daggers and carved away. </p><p>After digging for a while, she finally saw the heart. The heart itself was roughly two-fifths of her body size. </p><p>Rummaging around in the heart, she pulled out a Mana Stone the size of a large chicken egg. </p><p>"[Collect]" </p><p>The body disappeared and Shiro drank as much mana as she could. </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>Looking over at the list of loot, Shiro couldn't help but nod and appreciate the reward. At least it was worth her efforts. </p><p>Rewards consisted of a bunch of miscellaneous items fit for blacksmiths, pharmacists and alchemists. It also included several pieces of armour which were mostly (Blue) Ranked and a single Lucky Skill Stone. </p><p>Selling the miscellaneous items, she recycled the equipment she didn't need. </p><p>The equipment that remained were: </p><p>[Fire Spirit Infused Power Gauntlet (Blue) LVL20 </p><p>+20 STR </p><p>+15 VIT </p><p>-10 AGI </p><p>Skill – Power Boost </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>Power Boost – +100% damage, +15 STR, +30% Damage Taken </p><p>Duration – 20 Seconds </p><p>Cool Down – 5 Minutes] </p><p>[Empowered Fire Bear Guards (Blue) LVL20 </p><p>+20 DEF </p><p>+15 VIT </p><p>+ 5 STR] </p><p>[Fire Spirit Empowered Hammer (Blue) LVL20 </p><p>Requirements: 60 STR </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>+30 Blunt Damage </p><p>+15 Momentum Boost </p><p>+15 Fire Element </p><p>-10 Attack Speed </p><p>Passive Skill – Reduced Weight </p><p>Reduced Weight – Reduces the Weight of the weapon by 30%.] </p><p>The passive skill of the hammer was impressive as it would help counter the -10 Attack Speed. Shiro decided to save the hammer until she outgrew the level since it may help her. Recycling it right now would just be a waste of loot and might cause her to regret it later. </p><p>Turning her attention to the Lucky Skill Stone, she couldn't help but put on a slightly bitter face. </p><p>[Lucky Skill Stone (Purple) – Disguise </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>Disguise – Disguise your status from under any peeking eye. </p><p>Cost – 100MP upon activation. Will take another 100MP each time someone peaks at your stats. </p><p>Duration – Until cancellation </p><p>Cool Down – None] </p><p>There were a few types of Skill Stones. Lucky Skill Stones, Cursed Skill Stones, Blessed Skill Stones and normal Skill Stones. </p><p>Lucky Skill Stones gives you the skill you need at that moment in time. </p><p>Cursed Skill Stones give you a skill that would act like a double-edged sword. </p><p>Blessed Skill Stones would evolve one of your existing skills. This can be whichever skill you choose. </p><p>And finally, a normal Skill Stone which would give you a random skill according to your level. However, the skill may not be fit for you as it may be for a different class. </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>Shiro pulled a slightly bitter face due to the timing. </p><p>A Lucky Skill Stone was one of the rarest items, and it was a known fact that when you get this stone at a high level, this Lucky Skill Stone could very well give you a logic shattering skill. </p><p>In her past life, she had only ever heard of a handful of people getting the Lucky Skill Stones and never saw one. </p><p>Yet, this Lucky Skill Stone was wasted to get a Disguise skill. Was she supposed to be happy or sad? </p><p>She got a skill she needed but on the other hand, she wasted such a good item. It was akin to spending a million gold to buy a loaf of bread. </p><p>'Be grateful for what you get I guess?' She thought, crushing the stone and learnt the skill. </p><p>She checked her total stats with her new equipment included. </p><p>[Name: Shiro </p><p>Race: Snow Girl (Evolution Criteria yet to be met) </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>Title – [Elite Class] </p><p>Title Bonus - +10 In every stat </p><p>Level: 20 </p><p>Class: Snow Girl, Nanomancer </p><p>HP: 1430/3800 </p><p>MP: 20/4800 </p><p>STR: 35 (+25) +10 Title Bonus </p><p>VIT: 30 (+40) +10 Title Bonus </p><p>INT: 55 -&gt; 60 (+50) +10 Title Bonus </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>AGI: 50 (+5) +10 Title Bonus </p><p>DEX: 21 +10 Title Bonus </p><p>DEF: 10 (+32) +10 Title Bonus </p><p>Unassigned Points: 5-&gt;0 </p><p>Balance: 20,100 USD </p><p>Equipment: (Tap to display)] </p><p>Through killing the [Leader Class] Bear, she had managed to pseudo level up once. Since her equipment was changed, she lost +10 INT so she invested all 5 points into INT to try to make up for a little of that lost damage. </p><p>Looking at the destroyed surroundings due to the fight, she couldn't help but rub her nose slightly. </p><p>'This is just the destruction caused when I use my Ice powers. When I get the higher level Nanomancer skills, I would be the enemy of nature preservation.' She thought as the destructive prowess that came with the Nanomancer class was incredible. </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>She hopped onto a tree branch while she waited for her health to regenerate. </p><p>Taking this chance, she decided to see how the [Disguise] skill worked. </p><p>[Current Display: </p><p>Shiro – LVL20 – Snow Girl – Elite </p><p>HP: 1430/3800 </p><p>MP: 20/4800] </p><p>Seeing this, she now understood what the party of 5 saw when they looked at her. </p><p>'But why can they see my HP and MP?' She thought as she started to disguise it a little. </p><p>[Shiro – LVL20 – Ice Mage] </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>'There.' She thought with a smile. That way she can avoid them peering into her remaining HP and MP. </p><p>When her HP and MP were full, she touched the obelisk and tapped [3F]. Her vision cleared as she examined the room in front of her. </p><p>The room was surrounded with a black marble type material. Large pillars supported the roof as red flags could be seen hanging from the top. Towards the back of the room, a towering throne could be seen as a figure sat on the throne with an air of nonchalance. </p><p>It had black armour with neon orange highlights. It didn't wear a helmet as a ball of fire can be seen where the head was supposed to be. </p><p>"One fight after another huh? I'm game." Shiro grinned. </p><p>[Fire Spirit Knight – LVL 20 – BOSS] </p><p>### </p><p>"Where's the obelisk guardian?" A man asked as 7 people approached the obelisk. </p><p>"That's weird…." Another man muttered seeing the signs of battle. </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>"What there anyone else in the Dungeon except for you guys?" He asked. </p><p>The people he was looking at was the party of 5 Shiro met before. After waiting for 2 days, rescue came. Due to the time difference inside the Dungeon and the outside world, 1 day in the dungeon was 1 hour outside. </p><p>The backup was 2 D rank adventurers who were tasked to conquer the mutated Dungeon with the help of the party. </p><p>"There was no one apart from us." Xin Feng replied. </p><p>"Then the most likely situation would be a monster clashing with the obelisk guardian." The first man said as the party of 5 perked up. </p><p>"Why would a monster fight the guardian?" Trevor asked. </p><p>"It's uncommon but not unheard of. When a monster in the dungeon reaches a certain amount of intellect and strength, they will be freed of the dungeon's constraints. At this point, they'll be able to leave the Dungeon." The first man said frowning at the destruction. </p><p>"Ken, what class do you think the monster is? Has it reached D rank?" He asked. </p><p>"No it hasn't. But it's not far, Peak E class." Ken replied. </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>"Then we don't have to worry. A single Peak E class won't be able to solo an E rank Boss. It needs a party of 5 E ranks coordinating well with each other to beat one." The first man said in relief. </p><p>Entering the second floor, they made their way to the obelisk once more. </p><p>They froze seeing the destruction magnify by a few times. </p><div class="adsbox"></div><p>"D rank?" The man asked with a serious face. </p><p>"Definitely." Ken replied. </p><p>"Alright! Everyone prepare yourselves. The two monsters' may very well be fighting right now. We'll take advantage of this and finish them both off." He said as they nodded. </p><p>The party of 5 was nervous as they gulped unconsciously. </p><p>When their vision cleared, they froze in shock. </p><p>"!!!" </p><p class="wtgwgk"></p><p>The entire room was encased in ice as there were some parts thicker than others. Melted sections could also be seen as they knew whatever happened here was beyond their league. This shouldn't be something a single E ranked could output. </p><p>'The Snow Girl!!' The party of 5 though collectively since she was the only one staying in the Ice Element System whilst everything turned to the Fire Element System. </p><p>The first man's expression turned serious as he turned to Ken. </p><p>"Record this down. Saturday, 24th, January 2045. E rank Dungeon 14. Location, New York. Entry, Dungeon Monster Escape. Estimated Rank, D." The man said as Ken nodded and wrote everything down. </p><p>"Do you guys know anything about the monster?" The man asked turning to the five. </p><p>Xin Feng looked at his friends and nodded. </p><p>"We have a clue. It was a named monster called 'Shino' or something. S, H, I, N, O. Her race was Snow Girl." Xin Feng said as the man nodded. </p><p>"Put this through the guild." The man said as Ken entered everything into his device. </p><p>[Name – Shino </p><p>Estimated Danger Rank – D </p><p>Race – Snow Girl </p><p>Additional Information – Soloed an E rank Mutated Dungeon.] </p><p>The first ever record of Shiro in this world was a misspelt file... </p>
